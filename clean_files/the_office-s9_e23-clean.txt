Dwight: [mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring. n
Kevin: Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo! n
Stanley: Ah, Ixe2x80x99ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old. n
Meredith: Speech!n
Dwight: No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake isxe2x80xa6forxe2x80xa6Kevin. n
Kevin: Yes! Wait, why?n
Dwight: Go ahead and just read the frosting. n
Kevin: xe2x80x9cGet out.xe2x80x9dn
Dwight: Uh-huh. n
Kevin: What does that mean?n
Dwight: Itxe2x80x99s a colloquial way of saying xe2x80x9cyouxe2x80x99re fired,xe2x80x9d Kevin, which you are.n
Pam: What? Dwight, you canxe2x80x99t do that. n
Dwight: The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry. n
All: What?!n
Dwight: Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying. n

Kevin: Ixe2x80x99mxe2x80xa6good. n

Crowd: Whoo! Yeahn
Pam: [whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?n
Angela: [whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. Shexe2x80x99s disgusting. Those feet. Theyxe2x80x99re like the paws of an orangutan. n
Pam: I think she looks good. Now that shexe2x80x99s wearing sports bras, we donxe2x80x99t see her boobs as much. n
Dwight: That is all. Have a good morning. n
Meredith: Thank you.n
Dwight: [after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for? n
Angela: [laughing] To remind you that our weddingxe2x80x99s gonna be wonderful. n
Dwight: Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone. n
Angela: D, itxe2x80x99s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me. n
Dwight: Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that hexe2x80x99s been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him. n
Phyllis: Oh, some fudge?n
Malcolm: Oh, thanks. I love your fudge. n

Zeke: Party time! Whorehouse! n
Jim: Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwightxe2x80x99s night, okay? n
Dwight: Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That wonxe2x80x99t be necessary tonight. n
Clark: Great, now we got three hours to fill. n
Jim: Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isnxe2x80x99t going to show up? n
Dwight: Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, hexe2x80x99s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing. n
Andy: Yeah, sure, Ixe2x80x99ll talk about it. Why not? Americanxe2x80x99s next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord.

Meredith: Give the good show, my little entrepreneur. n
Jakey: Okay. n
Meredith: Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripperxe2x80x99s only as good as his song. n

Angela: Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith. n
Meredith: Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey. n

Jim: Oh, itxe2x80x99s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angelaxe2x80x99s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled. n
Dwight: Good old Mose. [laughing]n
Jim: They think it was Mose. n
Dwight: Oh, great. Hexe2x80x99s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung. n
Oscar: What is that? n
Dwight: A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose. n
Jim: Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub youxe2x80x99d ever set foot in in this town? n
Dwight: Right. Which one is that? n
Jim: Is that Mose?n
Dwight: Yes, it is! I am here for my bride! n
Mose: Well, first, buy us a drink. n
All: If you want your bride, buy us a drink! If you want your bride, buy us a drink. n
Dwight: Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  [Kevin turns around] Oh. n
Kevin: Well, well, well, well, well, well. Thatxe2x80x99s six xe2x80x9cwells.xe2x80x9d Did I get that number right, Dwight? n
Dwight: I heard you bought a bar, Kevin. n
Kevin: Yes. I did. This one. Now get out! n
Dwight: [to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]n
Jim: Ooh.n
Dwight: You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch. n
Jim: Nope, not a prank. I think itxe2x80x99s time for you to bury the hatchet. n
Dwight: Waste of a good hatchet. n
Jim: Okay, just talk. n
Kevin: Well, wxe2x80xa6n
Dwight: It was nothing personal. Itxe2x80x99s just that you were terrible at your job. n
Kevin: Youxe2x80x99re just saying that to make me feel better. n
Dwight: No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer. n
Kevin: Is that all it was? n
Dwight: Thatxe2x80x99s it. n
Kevin: Come here [hugs Dwight]n
Dwight: I missed you Kevin.n
Kevin: I missed you!n
Mose: Guten Prank. n
Dwight: Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk]n
Jim: Hey. Hey, is Angela coming orxe2x80xa6n
Dwight: No. We canxe2x80x99t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk. n
Jim: Right. n
Stanley: Hey guys. n
All: Stanley! n
Erin: Howxe2x80x99s Florida?n
Jim: Am I the only one thatxe2x80x99s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed? n
Pam: No, no, Ixe2x80x99m fine. n
Jim: Doesnxe2x80x99t seem like anyone cares about us anyway. n
Stanley: I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years. n
Kevin: [laughing] Yeah, people hate you. n
Man: Hey! Itxe2x80x99s Andy Bernard! n
All: Nard Dog! [cheers and claps] Ree-De-De-De-Doo! [repeats]n
Man 1: How did it feel to see your lives played out on tv? n
David Wallace: Itxe2x80x99s like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. Itxe2x80x99s kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didnxe2x80x99t wanna know any of it. n
Dwight: With todayxe2x80x99s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather itxe2x80x99s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were. n
Woman 1: Uh, Jim, that DVD in the last episode was so romantic. And, um, I think wexe2x80x99d all love to know, Pam, what romantic thing did you do to pay Jim back for leaving Athlead?n
Pam: Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I donxe2x80x99t know. Ixe2x80x99m working on something. n
Jim: She pays me back every day just by being my wife so thatxe2x80x99s fine. n
All: Awww.n
Woman 2: All I can say is, if I had Jim, he would have a free pass to do anything. I mean if I lucked into thatxe2x80xa6 he could do anything. Anything.n
Pam: [pause] Ixe2x80x99m sorry. Is there a question? n
Man 2: Pam, what was in that teapot letter? n
Pam: Oh, um, well, you know, Ixe2x80xa6 I justxe2x80xa6 I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if youxe2x80x99d been filmed for nine years of your life, therexe2x80x99d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself. n
Man 2: I hear ya. What did it say? n
Man 3: Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobodyxe2x80x99s actually filming you anymore?n
Woman 3: I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed. Was it accurate?n
Woman 4: I have a question for Jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how youxe2x80x99re soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia?n
Jim: Um, you know what, I actually didnxe2x80x99t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish. n
Pam: Listen, umxe2x80xa6 I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didnxe2x80x99t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because hexe2x80x99s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now itxe2x80x99s better than a fairy tale. Itxe2x80x99s like a long book that you never want to end.  And youxe2x80x99re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.n
Woman 4: Like Harry Potter.n
Joan: I have a question for Erin. n
Erin: Really?n
Joan: Yes. Um, the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother. n
Erin: Thank you. n
Joan: So my question is, um, doxe2x80xa6 donxe2x80x99t you hate her? I mean, I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her. n
Erin: Maybe sometimes. But not like xe2x80x9chatexe2x80x9d hate. More just like, xe2x80x9cMom, I hate you!xe2x80x9d And then she would say xe2x80x9cgo to your room, young lady.xe2x80x9d And Ixe2x80x99d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then wexe2x80x99d just have dinner together. But I donxe2x80x99t know. Ixe2x80x99d have to meet her. Thanks. n
Joan: Erinxe2x80xa6n
Erin: Yes?n
Joan: Umxe2x80xa6Oh, Erin..n
Erin: Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug]n
Ed: Erinxe2x80xa6 Same question but about your dad? [they hug]n

Kelly: Drake is your babyxe2x80x99s name?n
Ryan: Yeah.n
Kelly: That is an amazing name. Ixe2x80x99m obsessed with Drake. His last albumxe2x80xa6 it just touched me to pieces. n
Ryan: No Kelly, hexe2x80x99s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. Itxe2x80x99s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake. n
Kelly: Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. Ixe2x80x99m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos. n
Phyllis: Let me help you us.n
Angela: Thanks. [knees buckle] Oh. Ouch. n
Pam: Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high. n
Angela: No, my heels aren't too high. Itxe2x80x99s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didnxe2x80x99t know. As long as I can get to the altar. n
Jim: You ready?n
Dwight: [chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]n

Jim: I think itxe2x80x99s definitelyxe2x80xa6 Well, okay. Either wayxe2x80xa6n
Dwight: I think youxe2x80x99re only a teenyxe2x80xa6n

Jim: I justxe2x80xa6really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]n
Dwight: [turns around] [whispering] Michael. I canxe2x80x99t believe you came.n
Minister: As it is traditional to the Schrutes, the lovers are standing in their own graves as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do.n
Minister: I now pronounce you man and wife. [everyone cheers] Release the doves! [doves do not move right away]n

Pam: Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paperxe2x80xa6,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that Ixe2x80x99ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]n

Oscar: Yeah, but youxe2x80x99re not gay. Youxe2x80x99re not gay.n
Kevin: No, but maybe the reasonxe2x80xa6n
Pam: I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in allxe2x80xa6I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. Therexe2x80x99s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isnxe2x80x99t that kind of the point?n</div>]
