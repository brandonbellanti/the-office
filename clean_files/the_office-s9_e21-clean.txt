Jim: Ixe2x80x99m taking some time off from workxe2x80x94well, my other workxe2x80x94because we needed it.n
Pam: Itxe2x80x99s great.n
Jim: Itxe2x80x99s great.n
Pam: The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.n
Jim: But that doesnxe2x80x99t matter. This does. Itxe2x80x99s the only thing that matters. Wexe2x80x99ve had some really nice days together.n
Pam: Nice morning, too.n
Andy: Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agentxe2x80x99s putting me up for a furniture commercial.n
Jim: Ah, definitely blue.n
Andy: Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, whatxe2x80x99s up? Back in the small pond? n
Jim: For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thinxe2x80x94n
Andy: Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.n
Jim: Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I canxe2x80x99t give 100% to two things at once you know.n
Andy: Tell me about it, you know? Ixe2x80x99ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I donxe2x80x99t know if Ixe2x80x99m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup. n
Oscar: [noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?n
Angela: No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.n
Kevin: Wait, all of them?n
Angela: Two sacksxe2x80x99 worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.n
Oscar: Thatxe2x80x99sxe2x80x94thatxe2x80x99s awful, Angela. Ixe2x80x99m so sorry.n
Angela: Itxe2x80x99s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. Shexe2x80x99s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.n
Kevin: Ixe2x80x99ve never met anyone like that.n
Angela: And theyxe2x80x99re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone. n
Oscar: Angela, you still have your son.n
Dwight: Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher andxe2x80x94n
Jim: Smasher!n
Dwight: I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.n
Jim: Fireball!n
Dwight: Ah! [throws punch] Thatxe2x80x99s how itxe2x80x99s done.n
David Wallace: Hey, Erin. Is Andy in?n
Erin: Yes, therexe2x80x99s Andy! Andy is in. Ixe2x80x99m a good receptionist, I know hexe2x80x99s in. n
Andy: David Walrus, in his native habitat.n
David Wallace: Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk? n
David Wallace: Andyxe2x80x94n
Andy: Ixe2x80x99m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like itxe2x80x99s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.n
David Wallace: Uh-huh, butxe2x80x94n
Andy: Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And Ixe2x80x99ll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.n
David Wallace: So you think youxe2x80x99ve been too focused on your job?n
Andy: At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany. n
David Wallace: So youxe2x80x94you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?n
Andy: Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I donxe2x80x99txe2x80x94it justxe2x80xa6 I owe it to myself and my future fans. n
David Wallace: Uh, well, I guess I canxe2x80x99t stand in the way of a manxe2x80x99s dream. And it seems like you have the gift. n
Andy: Thank you, David.n
David Wallace: Therexe2x80x99s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?n
Andy: Nope. I have made up my mind. Ixe2x80x99m really sorry.n
David Wallace: Well, good luck.n
Andy: Thank you. Not gonna need it.n
Jim: Oh, Clark. Ixe2x80x99m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.n
Clark: Right. Yeah. But, you know, Ixe2x80x99ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like Ixe2x80x99ve earned this. I mean, you know?n
Jim: You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that Ixe2x80x99m here.n
Clark: Right. Well, Ixe2x80x99m here to sell paper. n
Pam: Wow.n
Clark: All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? Andxe2x80x94and Wallace is here today. And I donxe2x80x99t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here? n
Pam: itxe2x80x99s okay. You can sit in the annex.n
Jim: What?n
Pam: Ixe2x80x99ll come visit you.n
Jim: Okay. The annex it is. Ixe2x80x99ll be sitting at your desk if thatxe2x80x99s okay with you.n
Clark: Thatxe2x80x99s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Petexe2x80x99s beautiful, dead eyes.n
Andy: Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, Ixe2x80x99m taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.n
Oscar: I canxe2x80x99t say we didnxe2x80x99t see it coming. But itxe2x80x99s a sad day when anybody is fired. Wexe2x80x99re so sorry, Andy.n
David Wallace: Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired. n
Andy: I wasnxe2x80x99t fired. What are you talking about? Ixe2x80x99m fired up, yes. Guys, Ixe2x80x99mxe2x80x94Ixe2x80x99m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous. n
Pam: Oh, Andy.n
Jim: Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.n
Pete: Yeah, a little bit.n
Jim: Oh, wow. But, umxe2x80x94Oh, I get that. n
Pete: Oh, no, no, no. No itxe2x80x99s cool.n
Jim: I get it.n
Pete: Itxe2x80x99s cool, man. Ixe2x80x99m sure you and I will have our own thing.n
Darryl: I just think youxe2x80x99re going into this a little fast.n
Andy: Ixe2x80x99m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?n
Darryl: Show business is cold. Letxe2x80x99s say you get a job, which you probably wonxe2x80x99t. Theyxe2x80x99re not gonna cut you any slack. Youxe2x80x99re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack. n
Sensei: I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts.n
Dwight: He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!n
Sensei: Itxe2x80x99s not a large room, I think they heard me.n
Dwight: Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]n
Sensei: Thatxe2x80x99s really ok. Ixe2x80x99m mostly focused on the belt here.n
Dwight: Just slip it off myxe2x80x94Slip it off my hips. n
Sensei: Hold itxe2x80x94Take a step back. Take a step back. [they bow, then Dwight thrusts again] Okay, okay. I canxe2x80x99txe2x80x94I canxe2x80x99t do this if youxe2x80x99re gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think wexe2x80x99re gonna have to cut this off.n
Dwight: There it is. [everyone applauds]n
Sensei: Congratulations.n
Dwight: We did it, we did it. I love you.n
Sensei: Okay. n
Dwight: Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. Youxe2x80x99re gonna watch me right?n
Sensei: Yes, I will. [Dwight starts doing karate] n
Dwight: Sensei, youxe2x80x99re not watching. n
Sensei: Yeah, Ixe2x80x99m watching. Just do it.n
Dwight: Watching?n
Sensei: Ixe2x80x99m watching.n
Dwight: Watch this part, okay?n
David Wallace: Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?n
Sensei: Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world. n
David Wallace: He said that? Hexe2x80x99s an odd guy, isnxe2x80x99t he?n
Sensei: Yes. Irritating, also yes. But I gotta hand it to him, hexe2x80x99s one of the most tenacious and determined men Ixe2x80x99ve ever met. [Dwight finishes his routines and everyone applauds]n
Jim: I really felt like I almost lost her, andxe2x80x94and nothing is worth that.n
Clark: Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.n
Dwight: You did not just say that! You donxe2x80x99t know Pam. She is really cool.n
Clark: All Ixe2x80x99m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the managerxe2x80x99s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.n
David Wallace: So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on. n
Jim: Again. n
David Wallace: Again! And Ixe2x80x99m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?n
Jim: Not at all. It should be Dwight.n
David Wallace: You sure?n
Jim: Youxe2x80x99re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uhxe2x80x94n
David Wallace: Yeah.n
Nellie: Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.n
Andy: Itxe2x80x99s now or never. n
Nellie: Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.n
Andy: Yeah, sure. Whatxe2x80x99s your question?n
Kevin: Our question isxe2x80x94it seems dumb.n
Andy: Well, itxe2x80x99s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?n
Nellie: Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and xe2x80x9cfull-assxe2x80x9d it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?n
Andy: Nah. I like my plan better.n
Kevin: Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. Youxe2x80x99re too character-y to be a lead and youxe2x80x99re not fat enough to be a great character actor.n
Jim: Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?n
Pam: Yes. Yeah. n
Jim: I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.n
Pam: Oh, boy. Umxe2x80x94n
Jim: If you could help me out, that would bexe2x80x94n
Pam: I could give you some beginner stickies?n
Jim: Anything would help.n
Pam: Here you go.n
Jim: Oh, also, while youxe2x80x99re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.n
Pam: Mm-hmm. n
Jim: Wow, thatxe2x80x99sxe2x80x94n
Pam: Itxe2x80x99s all yours.n
Jim: You come so prepared. Aspirin.n
Dwight: You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.n
Jim: Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. Itxe2x80x99s really great.n
Dwight: Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the managerxe2x80x99s job?n
Jim: No. He was maybe thinking of you for it. n
Dwight: Yeah, right. Ixe2x80x99m afraid that ship has sailed.n
Dwight: Hello.n
Andy: Well, hello.n
Dwight: Big day for you.n
Andy: Big day for you.n
Dwight: Thank you.n
Andy: Love the belt.n
Dwight: Oh, yes.n
Andy: You know, I donxe2x80x99t know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dogxe2x80x99s outta here, so letting it all hang out!n
Dwight: This is exciting! Youxe2x80x99re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.n
Andy: Thank you, I appreciate that. xe2x80x98Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.n
Dwight: Oh, I doubt youxe2x80x99ll make it. Very few do whoxe2x80x99ve tried to be a star. But, listen, youxe2x80x99ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?n
Andy: No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.n
Dwight: Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, donxe2x80x99t quit your day job.n
Andy: [cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney. n
Andy: Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. Thatxe2x80x99s something you canxe2x80x99t take back. n
Erin: So true. Is there a question, or arexe2x80x94what? n
Andy: Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor? n
Erin: Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve. n
Andy: Thank you. [steps into conference room]n
David Wallace: You can stay on as a salesman, Andy. n
Andy: Thank you. [leaves]n
Dwight: Say it again.n
David Wallace: Will you be the new manager?n
Dwight: Where?n
David Wallace: Where?n
Dwight: What branch?n
David Wallace: Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Letxe2x80x99s go. Itxe2x80x99s good news.n
Dwight: Ixe2x80x99m sorry. Ixe2x80x99ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun. n
David Wallace: What?n
Dwight: But this isnxe2x80x99t interim manager. No. Itxe2x80x99s Dwight K. Schrutexe2x80xa6 [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.n
David Wallace: Why do you already have this?n
Dwight: In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.n
David Wallace: I know.n
Dwight: I will never, ever let you down.n
Pam: Hey.n
Jim: Wow, hey.n
Pam: Hi.n
Jim: Whatxe2x80x99s up?n
Pam: Um, I have a question.n
Jim: Okay.n
Pam: Oh, I had a question.n
Jim: Really?n
Pam: I did!n
Jim: Yeah, totally you did.n
Pam: Super important.n
Jim: I need you to stay right here while you think about it.n
Pam: Okay.n
Jim: All right? Ixe2x80x99m gonna wait.n
Pam: All right. I did not come back here just to see you.n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99m sure you did not. What was your question?n
Pam: I donxe2x80x99t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.n
Jim: Well, then, I should figure out things to do while Ixe2x80x99m waiting.n
Andy: Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. Ixe2x80x99m gonna stay on in sales.n
Nellie: Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.n
Meredith: Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Donxe2x80x99t want to see you in a porn next year.n
Andy: Okay. n
Kevin: Ooh, therexe2x80x99s a great play about a salesman.n
Andy: Death of a salesman.n
Kevin: I donxe2x80x99t think so.n
Andy: Sure, xe2x80x98Death of a Salesmanxe2x80x99 by Arthur Miller, itxe2x80x99s a great play about crushed dreams.n
Kevin: No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.n
Pete: See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.n
Erin: I had no idea. And here Ixe2x80x99ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickinxe2x80x99 sheep.n
Jim: Look whoxe2x80x99s back.n
Pam: Ixe2x80x99m back. Oh, hey, look, and now itxe2x80x99s like a double date. n
Pete: Wow. Cause, uh [gestures to him and Erin and then to Pam and Jim with sound effects]n
Erin: Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. Thatxe2x80x99d be fun. n
Pam: Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.n
Erin: Well, how about Thursday?n
Pam: Oh, well, Thursdayxe2x80x99s tough, because ofxe2x80x94n
Jim: Weeknights are actually tough just becausexe2x80x94n
Pam: They are.n
Jim: Thatxe2x80x99s true, yeah.n
David Wallace: Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrutexe2x80x94n
Dwight: David. Can I just do one thing while youxe2x80x99re making this announcement and then Ixe2x80x99ll never, ever do it again?n
David Wallace: I donxe2x80x99t think so.n
Dwight: Itxe2x80x99s just one thing. Just let mexe2x80x94let me do thisxe2x80x94n
David Wallace: Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come onxe2x80x94what I was about to say was Dwightxe2x80x94[phone buzzes] Oh, Ixe2x80x99m sorry, I gottaxe2x80x94Thisxe2x80x99ll be a second, sorry.n

Clark: Congrats, Dwight.n
Dwight: Get out of Jimxe2x80x99s seat.n
Clark: But I fought for this seat.n
Dwight: Youxe2x80x99re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, wexe2x80x99ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.n
Pam: Itxe2x80x99s nice to have you back.n
Dwight: Soxe2x80xa6n
Jim: So.n
Dwight: I wanted to offer you a new position.n
Jim: Letxe2x80x99s hear it.n
Dwight: Assistant regional manager.n
Jim: Nope. Canxe2x80x99t accept that job. Itxe2x80x99s not a real job.n
Dwight: Jim.n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one Ixe2x80x99d be proud to take. n
Dwight: So, all the numbers adding up?n

Andy: Uh, dream. Goinxe2x80x99 with my dream. Gotta go all in, isnxe2x80x99t that right, Jim?n
Jim: Oh, donxe2x80x99t look at me cause I think youxe2x80x99re making a terrible choice. n
Andy: Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all. n
Toby: Okay, then, Andy.n
Andy: Yeah, but herexe2x80x99s the thing. I canxe2x80x99t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else Ixe2x80x99ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners. n
Toby: Andy, you know I canxe2x80x99t do that. Itxe2x80x99d be lying.n
Andy: Seriously?n
Toby: Yeah, Ixe2x80x99mxe2x80x94n
Andy: Come on, just do it.n
Toby: I canxe2x80x99t.n
Andy: All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. [starts touching Tobyxe2x80x99s thighs] n
Toby: [fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.n

Andy: This is yourxe2x80x94you brought this on.n
Toby: No, no. Andy. n
Angela: [answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if therexe2x80x99s a problem itxe2x80x99s clearly on your end. Andxe2x80x94oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... umxe2x80xa6 what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didnxe2x80x99t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control shouldxe2x80x99ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]n
Andy: David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And Ixe2x80x99d just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite. n
David Wallace: We put the past behind us, though, Andy. n
Andy: What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?n
David Wallace: Enough, Andy. Enough!n
Andy: Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?n
Angela: Andy.n
Andy: Yeah.n
Angela: What are you doing?n
Andy: Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it donxe2x80x99t squash my knickety-knacks on top. n
Angela: Yeah, okay. Thatxe2x80x99s not what I mean. You donxe2x80x99t have to leave because you said you would. Donxe2x80x99t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? Itxe2x80x99s not worth it.n
Andy: Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot tooxe2x80x94n

Andy: A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.n
Nellie: Oh, good lord.n
Stanley: Canxe2x80x99t you just leave?n
Jim: You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.n
Andy: Tuna, Ixe2x80x99m a performer. And perform I shall. [sings xe2x80x98I Will Remember Youxe2x80x99xe2x80x94everyone is slightly impressed]n
Dwight: [whispering] You okay?n

Stanley: Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.n
Phyllis: No, hexe2x80x99s good. n
Oscar: Good night, Kevin.n
Kevin: Night, Oscar.n
Oscar: Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar. n
Angela: Well, Ixe2x80x99ve changed my mind.n
Oscar: Wait a minute. Youxe2x80x99re not thinking of living in axe2x80x94n
Angela: Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?n
Oscar: Okay, Ixe2x80x99m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent. n
Angela: Oh, god. n
Oscar: Come stay with me. n
Angela: You donxe2x80x99t want me at your place. n
Oscar: I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which wonxe2x80x99t be long. Itxe2x80x99s the least I could do.n
Angela: Wellxe2x80xa6n
Oscar: Separate bathrooms.n
Angela: Thank you.n
Oscar: Youxe2x80x99re welcome. Letxe2x80x99s go get Phillip. Then wexe2x80x99ll get your stuffxe2x80xa6n
