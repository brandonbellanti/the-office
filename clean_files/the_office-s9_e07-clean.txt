Andy: [on computer screen] Ah, what else? Ixe2x80x99ve seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times.  Breaks my heart every time, you know?n
Everyone: Whoa!n
Pam: Andy.n
Andy: That Swayze sure can dance dirty.n
Phyllis: Donxe2x80x99t you have any sunblock?n
Andy: [on computer] Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. Thatxe2x80x99s what I call the sun now.n
Darryl: Andy, itxe2x80x99s Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.n
Andy: What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!n
Erin: Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?n
Andy: Yeah, it was. Thatxe2x80x99s okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out.  Ow!n
Everyone: Oh!n
Andy: [on computer] I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.n
Erin: [laughing] Yeah.n
Andy: No. No! Nooo! [computer falls into ocean]n
Dwight: [answering phone] Dwight Schrute. [turns on speakerphone] Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?n
David: [on speakerphone] Well, I have some very exciting news.n
Dwight: And you didnxe2x80x99t call Jim - that seems significant.n
Jim: Hi, David.n
David: Jim, good! You should hear this too.n
Dwight: No, he shouldnxe2x80x99t.n
Jim: [taking away Dwightxe2x80x99s handset] Go ahead David, Ixe2x80x99m listening.n
Dwight: Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I donxe2x80x99t know where Ixe2x80x99d put you.n
David: Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. Theyxe2x80x99ve apparently just dropped the supplier theyxe2x80x99ve been with for the last ten years. .n
David: Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you.n
Dwight: Ixe2x80x99m gonna need to put you on hold for a second. [presses hold button] Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... wherexe2x80x99s Stanley?n
Erin: Hexe2x80x99s in the bathroom.n
Dwight: Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?n
Erin: Of course.n
Dwight: Yeah! Okay. [presses button again] Hey David, Ixe2x80x99m back.n
Erin: [from the kitchen] Eat it Stanley!n
Dwight: So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?n
David: No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. Itxe2x80x99s someone new but she didnxe2x80x99t catch her name.n
Dwight: Her name?n
Phyllis: No, hey, Dwight shouldnxe2x80x99t...n
Dwight: Shhh! [clears throat] Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!n
David: Good luck!n
Dwight: Good luck to you. [disconnects call]n
Phyllis: Dwight, you canxe2x80x99t go. You have a problem with women. You canxe2x80x99t sell to them.n
Dwight: That is a damnable lie. I love women.n
Phyllis: Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her xe2x80x98gy-naxe2x80x99 for your entire meeting.n
Nellie: Ew. Thatxe2x80x99s not good.n
Phyllis: Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.n
Dwight: xe2x80x98Gy-naxe2x80x99 said that?n
Phyllis: Guys, we canxe2x80x99t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.n
Meredith: Hey remember that week in the 90xe2x80x99s when we got bagels?n
Creed: I miss Clinton.n
Pam: Can you go instead?n
Pete: Okay, call down. Itxe2x80x99s just me, not Tom Selleck.n
Guys in breakroom: [laughter]n
Pete: Toby got us all to participate in Movember. Itxe2x80x99s a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November.n
Darryl: Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?n
Angela: Hi.n
Oscar: Hi.n
Angela: Spring cleaning?n
Oscar: More like fall cleaning. [chuckles]n
Angela: [whispering] I think the senator is having an affair.n
Oscar: [dropping desk drawer] This doesnxe2x80x99t... Ixe2x80x99m sorry. Wha... what?n
Angela: When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.n
Oscar: Oh, Ixe2x80x99m sure ...thatxe2x80x99s nothing.n
Angela: And hexe2x80x99s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - itxe2x80x99s Hot Yoga with Blake.n
Oscar: Angela, Blakexe2x80x99s also a guyxe2x80x99s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?n
Angela: I donxe2x80x99t know.n
Oscar: I just never heard about the senator and yoga...n
Angela: Right.n
Oscar: From you. Ixe2x80x99m sure itxe2x80x99s probably nothing. But whatxe2x80x99s with the yoga already?n
Angela: Right?n
Oscar: And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.n
Angela: What?n
Phyllis: So, uh, show us how youxe2x80x99d normally sell to a female client.n
Dwight: Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.n
Pam: Youxe2x80x99ve got this Schrute.n
Phyllis: Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.n
Dwight: Hello.n
Erin: Hello.n
Dwight: May I please speak to your boss?n
Phyllis: No, she is the boss.n
Erin: I am? Hmm..  [deep voice] Hi, Ixe2x80x99m Mr. Hannon.  How can I help you?n
Dwight: Okay, this isnxe2x80x99t working for me, xe2x80x98cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.n
Erin: Hexe2x80x99s absolutely right. Ixe2x80x99m really struggling.n
Pam: Oh, Ixe2x80x99ll be the buyer.n
Dwight: [sighing]n
Pam: Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.n
Dwight: I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutesn
Phyllis: No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.n
Dwight: I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once Ixe2x80x99m finished, itxe2x80x99s over.n
Pam: Okay, letxe2x80x99s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?n
Dwight: I thought it went great.n
Business partner: [on phone] Okay lets get started.n
Jim: Yeah, Ixe2x80x99m here. Are we all on?n
Business partner: Uh,, well youxe2x80x99re the only one xe2x80x98onxe2x80x99 - wexe2x80x99re all here.n
Jim: [nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...n
Kevin: Thatxe2x80x99s the winter season., three months.n
Jim: I uh, I have some ideas, actually...n
Business partner: Are you at your office right now?n
Jim: [hushed voice] Uh yeah. Trust me, Ixe2x80x99d rather be with you guys.n
Business partner: [laughing] Uh, yeah, that sounded kinda spooky-sexy, over here Halpert.n
Jim: Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...n
Business partner: Whoa. [laughing] I think therexe2x80x99s been a bit of a mistake. Wexe2x80x99re trying to reach Jim Halpert, not Batman.n
Jim: [laughing]  Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.n
Business partner: Uh, yeah...n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99m gonna try a different spot. Okay?n
Business partner: Okay, yeah.n
Jim: Okay, Ixe2x80x99ll call you right back.n
Pam: Okay, when youxe2x80x99re selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?n
Dwight: Yes.n
Pam: Okay, well you have to show us.n
Dwight: Thatxe2x80x99s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs donxe2x80x99t vibrate at all.n
Pam: Huh. [nodding] Uh huh.n
Dwight: What are you doing?n
Pam: A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?n
Dwight: Kind of.n
Pam: Nellie, why donxe2x80x99t you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that youxe2x80x99re listening.n
Nellie:  Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that Ixe2x80x99ve commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking  color schemes and the major themes we want to hit.  Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper.  But not in a child labor-y way.n
Erin: Itxe2x80x99s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.n
Dwight: I am a person.n
Erin: Yes.n
Nellie: And then we thought wexe2x80x99d xe2x80xa6 I canxe2x80x99t. I just canxe2x80x99t  carry on with that face. Look at it. Ixe2x80x99m gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like hexe2x80x99s laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.n
Dwight: Thatxe2x80x99s a bit extreme.n
Nellie: No, Ixe2x80x99m sorry but that is true.n
Meredith: Hexe2x80x99s screwed. Theyxe2x80x99re meeting in less than an hour.n
Phyllis: Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. Itxe2x80x99s all garbage okay? Youxe2x80x99re the woman, Ixe2x80x99m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.n
Dwight: Okay, Ixe2x80x99m a woman. [high voice] Ixe2x80x99m a woman. Good?n
Phyllis: Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.n
Dwight: Hello.n
Phyllis: Oh, are those your kids? Theyxe2x80x99re so cute! They could be models.n
Dwight: Thank you. Ixe2x80x99m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.n
Meredith: Booo! Weird.n
Nellie: No.n
Pam: You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.n
Dwight: Look, I have no problem with women. Itxe2x80x99s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Donxe2x80x99t lie about your shoulders!n
Pam: Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?n
Dwight: I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.n
Pam: Okay, so, when youxe2x80x99re selling to this woman, just imagine that shexe2x80x99s that nice, reasonable barber.n
Dwight: Okay, I can do that.n
Pam: Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.n
Dwight: He used to fight dogs.n
Pam: Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?n
Angela: Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.n
Oscar: Angela! [whispering] Angela. There.n
Angela: Where?n
Oscar: [whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.n
Angela: Oh my God! Shexe2x80x99s so stunningly tiny!  Shexe2x80x99s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what theyxe2x80x99re doing.n
Oscar: Shexe2x80x99s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.n
Angela: [gasps] Ixe2x80x99ve heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. Ixe2x80x99d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Letxe2x80x99s go.n
Oscar: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...n
Angela: Ow.n
Pete: [sound effect of throwing ball]n
Jim: What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --n
Business partner: [on phone] It was in what? Jim, wexe2x80x99re having a lot of trouble hearing you.n
Jim: The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was...[car alarm blaring] was in the...n
Hank: Hey! Are those skateboarders back?n
Business partner: [on phone] Jim? Jim, are you there?n
Hank: Where are they?n
Jim: It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...n
Meredith: Who was messing with my van?n
Jim: Nobody!n
Business partner: [on phone]  Jordan wore them for nobody? Wexe2x80x99re not following you, Halpert.n
Jim: No, no, no.n
Secretary: Have a seat. Um, she will be right in.n
Pam: Oh, great. Oh, Ixe2x80x99m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we donxe2x80x99t have it.n
Secretary: Uh... um shexe2x80x99ll be right in.n
Pam: Okay, great.n
Dwight: [to himself] Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.n
Pam: Oh my God. Itxe2x80x99s Jan.n
Pam: Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.n</div>, <div class="quote">n[scene from Dinner Party, Season 4 and The Job Season 3]n
Pam: Forget everything we taught you.  Hey, Jan! Itxe2x80x99s so great to see you.n
Jan: Wherexe2x80x99s Wallace?n
Pam: What?n
Jan: I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?n
Dwight: Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. [laughs]n
Pam: Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.n
Jan: Molly! David Wallace is in Vermont.n
Molly: Oh, my God. Um, I talked to his assistant.  And I guess it did get a little confusing  xe2x80x98cause you said not to tell anyone your name.  And then also, those bluetooths are very hard to hear with. I know you love the way they look, but Tom never had us use them...n
Jan: Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.n
Molly: Ixe2x80x99m so sorry Jan.n
Jan: I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace  after all these years.  Oh, well. What are you doing?n
Dwight: Listening.n
Jan: Stop.n
Dwight: Sorry.n
Jan: Stop that.n
Dwight: Okay.n
Pam: So this was all just a trick. You donxe2x80x99t really have any business to give?n
Jan: No, I do.n
Pam: But not to us.n
Jan: Insightful, Pam.n
Pam: You did good, Dwight. Itxe2x80x99s okay. I mean, seriously, Janxe2x80x99s not normal. Letxe2x80x99s just go. Shexe2x80x99s not going to sell to us.n
Dwight: Yes, she is. Now,  I may not have any instincts with women, but I have  an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. Ixe2x80x99ll be right back.n
Pam: What?n
Jan: Pam?n
Pam: Yeah.n
Jan: Ixe2x80x99m a very busy woman, so...n
Pam: Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?n
Pete: Erin, did this call...n
Erin: Uh!n
Pete: What?n
Erin: Sorry, I uh, just saw your face.n
Pete: Oh, Ixe2x80x99m sorry. Itxe2x80x99s for the thing.n
Erin: I know. Thatxe2x80x99s great. It just - it makes it look like therexe2x80x99s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.n
Pete: Wow.n
Erin: A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isnxe2x80x99t bad.n
Pete: Uh-huh.n
Erin: But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. Itxe2x80x99s such a great cause.n
Pete: Yeah.n
Jan: [audio from slide show, singing] Mommy, youxe2x80x99re a princess. Mommy, youxe2x80x99re a superstar. Mommy youxe2x80x99re the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?n
Pam: Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.n
Jan: Aw.n
Pam: And it is so cute how she signs her name.n
Jan: [chuckles] Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.n
Pam: Oh, okay. Itxe2x80x99s just thatxe2x80x99s how Cece does it with the backwards xe2x80x98Exe2x80x99s.n
Jan: Cece canxe2x80x99t spell her name.n
Pam: Oh, actually she can.n
Jan: Well, itxe2x80x99s not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, xe2x80x9cCecexe2x80x9d is two letters and xe2x80x9cAstridxe2x80x9d is... I mean, therexe2x80x99s even some adults who -- who -- who canxe2x80x99t spell it.n
Pam: Of course.n
Jan: Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.n
Pam: Um... xe2x80x9cAxe2x80x9d... xe2x80x9cXxe2x80x9d? I donxe2x80x99t -- you got me.n
Jan: Donxe2x80x99t patronize me.n
Angela: [whispering] Okay, we should go now. Letxe2x80x99s go.n
Oscar: [stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs]n
Angela: Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Canxe2x80x99t get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire --n
Oscar: [whispering] Please. Itxe2x80x99s Robert whoxe2x80x99s enjoying it.n
Angela: What?n
Pam: Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?n
Jan: No.n
Dwight: Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well Ixe2x80x99ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.n
Pam: Oh, my God.n
Clark: Wherexe2x80x99s the Quiznoxe2x80x99s?n
Dwight: Youxe2x80x99re the Quiznoxe2x80x99s. [chuckles] Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasnxe2x80x99t quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?n
Jan: I -- I --n
Dwight: Hmm?n
Jan: I donxe2x80x99t recall. And yes, Molly is crap.n
Pam: Okay, you do not have to do this.n
Clark: Do what? Get into sales? Thatxe2x80x99s what I want.n
Dwight: Hexe2x80x99s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.n
Jan: Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.n
Dwight: Very good.n
Jim: Jim Halpert.n
Colin: [on phone] Hey, itxe2x80x99s Colin.n
Jim: Hey man. I am so sorry about that.n
Colin: I know. Donxe2x80x99t worry about it.n
Jim: [laughs]n
Colin: Itxe2x80x99s just... itxe2x80x99s not totally working.n
Jim: Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But donxe2x80x99t worry. Ixe2x80x99ll figure it out.n
Colin: Yeah, well, itxe2x80x99s not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I donxe2x80x99t know how wexe2x80x99re gonna do this.n
Angela: Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?n
Oscar: I donxe2x80x99t know, Angela. Ixe2x80x99m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.n
Angela: Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?n
Oscar: Hexe2x80x99s making a phone call.n
Angela: [ducking under table with Oscar] Oh. Oh.n
Pam: Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.n
Molly: Thanks. Okay.n
Dwight: Oh and uh, Molly... I know it canxe2x80x99t be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.n
Pam: Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.n
Dwight: Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.n
Pam: Thatxe2x80x99s a license number?n
Dwight: Thatxe2x80x99s all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.n
Pam: Oh. Why me?n
Dwight: Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. Itxe2x80x99s like air to you people. Ugh, God. [retching]n</div>]
