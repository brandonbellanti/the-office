Dwight: [on phone with Jim] I hope youxe2x80x99ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because itxe2x80x99s time for another episode of xe2x80x9cHandsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hirexe2x80x9d.n
Jim: Sorry, Stinky, canxe2x80x99t do it. Too busy.n
Dwight: Oh, god, this again? Youxe2x80x99re Stinky.n
Jim: Okay. Therexe2x80x99s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.n
Dwight: Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.n
Phyllis: I have ears, Dwight.n
Dwight: Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim?n
Jim: Hey, Ixe2x80x99m in Philadelphia right now.n
Dwight: How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.n
Jim: Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?n
Nellie: Darryl, looking good!n
Darryl: Heading to Philly. Interview with Jimxe2x80x99s company.n
Pam: Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?n
Darryl: Why donxe2x80x99t you come along and tell him yourself?n
Pam: Ha ha. Thatxe2x80x99d be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you getxe2x80xa6 What do you get? Oh my god! Why didnxe2x80x99t I think of this? Andyxe2x80x99s not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, Ixe2x80x99m expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?n
Erin: Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.n
Pam: A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everythingxe2x80x99s in order.n
Erin: What? Everything? What, how do I make sure itxe2x80x99s in order? I [laughs] havenxe2x80x99t been trained for this.n
Clark: Hey guys.n
Phyllis: Clark!n
Meredith: Hey!n
Oscar: Hey, look whoxe2x80x99s back, Dwight Junior.n
Kevin: Hey, so how was it? I meanxe2x80xa6 the sex with Jan.n
Meredith: Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, xe2x80x9cTalk classy, act nastyxe2x80x9d.n
Clark: Whatxe2x80x99s with the wig Meredith?n
Meredith: What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head]n
Clark: Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. Itxe2x80x99s an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast soxe2x80xa6 bon appetite.n
Phyllis: Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now thatxe2x80x99s Italian.n
Oscar: My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.n
Meredith: Always with the friends Oscar. Canxe2x80x99t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?n
Dwight: There he is! [chuckles] We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, butxe2x80xa6n
Clark: If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.n
Dwight: Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uhxe2x80xa6 No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?n
Clark: [sarcastically chuckling] I loved it.n
Dwight: How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?n
Clark: If itxe2x80x99ll lead to me being a salesman, Ixe2x80x99ll pretend to be your friend.n
Erin: Hi guys!n
Pete: Hey, look who it is!n
Erin: Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.n
Oscar: Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso]n
Pam: You ready for your interview?n
Darryl: I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andyxe2x80x99s job in the bag until my interview.n
Pam: Well, you shouldnxe2x80x99t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.n
Darryl: Yeah, I guessxe2x80xa6n
Suit Store Father: [chuckling] Itxe2x80x99s kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store.n
Dwight: You know, youxe2x80x99re right! We hadnxe2x80x99t even thought of that, had we boy? [to Clark]n
Clark: No, we sure hadnxe2x80x99t Pop. [both chuckling]n
Dwight: [Takes picture from desk] Oh! Youxe2x80x99re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clarkxe2x80x99s shoulder]n
Clark: He calls me Clarky xe2x80x98cause hexe2x80x99s my Dad.n
Dwight: Guilty!n
Suit Store Father: You donxe2x80x99t meet many hunters these days.n
Clark: My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, hexe2x80x99s like a serial killerxe2x80xa6 of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick! [Dwight imitates sawing and blood spurting out of his neck, then makes a dying noise]n
Dwight: It was his birthday, just turned three. Soxe2x80xa6n
Oscar: You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?n
Nellie: No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?n
Kevin: Taste test? Ixe2x80x99m in!n
Oscar: YOLO! [singing and dancing]n
Phyllis: What? [everyone is confused]n
Oscar: Itxe2x80x99s a thing. It means xe2x80x9cyou only live oncexe2x80x9d.n
Kevin: Yeah, wexe2x80x99re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.n
Oscar: Wellxe2x80xa6n
Kevin: Alright everybody, whoxe2x80x99s in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Donxe2x80x99t make us come over there.n
Angela: No, I donxe2x80x99txe2x80xa6 no.n
Kevin: Alright, letxe2x80x99s go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela]n
Angela: Canxe2x80x99t I just agree without putting my hand in?n
Nellie: Absolutely not!n
Kevin: No way.n
Angela: Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone elsexe2x80x99s hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin]n
Kevin: Ok guys, xe2x80x9cwe all drink them allxe2x80x9d.n
Everyone: [Meredith, Phyllis, Nellie, Angela, Creed, Oscar, Stanley] We all drink them all!n
Kevin: Yes!n
Oscar: Yes!n
Nellie: Whoo!n
Phyllis: Hey, wherexe2x80x99s my ring?n
Athlead Employee: [in the background] Yes maxe2x80x99am, you want to go east on Franklin, take that all the way to Commonweath. Youxe2x80x99ll see us on the right side, you canxe2x80x99t miss us.n
Dennis: xe2x80xa6And I want to reach every demographic possible.n
Jim: No, I hear what youxe2x80x99re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?n
Dennis: Wexe2x80x99re talking weeks here, not months, right?n
Jim: Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.n
Dennis: Alright. Good.n
Jim: Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. [To Pam] Hey! How are you?n
Pam: Good!n
Jim: What are you doing here?n
Pam: I just wanted to see you!n
Jim: Thatxe2x80x99s so great!n
Darryl: Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!n
Jim: Itxe2x80x99s pretty great, right? I mean, wexe2x80x99re coming alongxe2x80xa6 [to coworker] Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennisxe2x80x99s timelinen
Wade: Okayn
Dwight: xe2x80xa6But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clarkxe2x80x99s getting out of my car. Hexe2x80x99s a good boy, does whatever I say.n
Suit Store Father: [sighs] I canxe2x80x99t relate to that, my son hates my guts.n
Dwight: Ohxe2x80xa6 really.n
Suit Store Father: Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that?n
Dwight: [fumbling] Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that theyxe2x80x99re not even good. Really, theyxe2x80x99re bad. Like you and your son.n
Clark: [enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, butxe2x80xa6 God I missed you!n
Dwight: What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?n
Clark: [confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.n
Dwight: Youxe2x80x99re being disrespectful!n
Clark: xe2x80xa6And I love you, for saying that.n
Dwight: [whispers to Clark] We donxe2x80x99t get along.n
Clark: [catches on] Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth isxe2x80xa6 our relationship isxe2x80xa6 terr-n
Dwight: Terrible!n
Clark: Terrible.n
Pam: Wow, this place isxe2x80xa6 so great. I had no idea xe2x80x93 on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.n
Jim: Well, I mean, I donxe2x80x99t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, soxe2x80xa6 These things go down all the time.n
Darryl: If this companyxe2x80x99s going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.n
Jim: [to Pam] Are you cool to just hang out?n
Pam: Sure, no problem.n
Jim: Yeah? [to Darryl] You ready?n
Darryl: Yeah.n
Nellie: A-bam! [slams espresso cup on table] My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor Ixe2x80x99ve tried so far is Alpine Select!n
Kevin: Yes! [giggles and picks up Angela]n
Angela: Ugh!n
Kevin: One! [as he picks Angela up in the air]n
Angela: Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!n
Kevin: Twoxe2x80xa6 [picks Angela up again]n
Angela: Stop it!n
Kevin: Threexe2x80xa6n
Oscar: Thatxe2x80x99s enough Kevin.n
Angela: Stop it Kevin!n
Kevin: Four!n
Oscar: Thatxe2x80x99s enough!n
Clark: So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing.n
Suit Store Father: I heard that beforexe2x80xa6n
Clark: Well, I understand, but xe2x80x93n
Dwight: I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.n
Clark: Here we go again, another lecture from the old man.n
Suit Store Father: Listen to him. He created you.n
Dwight: Maybe if you listened a little bit, youxe2x80x99d improve. No wonder women despise you.n
Clark: Women donxe2x80x99t despise mexe2x80xa6n
Dwight: His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adamxe2x80x99s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldnxe2x80x99t see it, or didnxe2x80x99t wanna see it.n
Clark: Alright, thatxe2x80x99s enough, xe2x80x98cause I can say some things about him too.n
Dwight: Yeah? Like what?n
Clark: Like the time that you got drunk and, and thenxe2x80xa6 Killed those kids on their way to prom!n
Dwight: That never happened. Hexe2x80x99s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught xe2x80x9csaving treatsxe2x80x9d from the kitty litter box.n
Suit Store Father: Really shamefulxe2x80xa6n
Clark: So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-n
Dwight: Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.n
Clark: Therexe2x80x99s obviously a volume discount uh, if you-n
Dwight: Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going xe2x80x9cplease kitty, may I have some more?xe2x80x9d You canxe2x80x99t make this stuff up!n
Clark: No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends.n
Suit Store Son: Hey fellas, sorry to keep you waiting.n
Suit Store Father: Here he is, my son.n
Dwight: [scoffs] Got cat turd collector written all over him.n
Athlead Employee: ...So definitely looking to expand our market, but for now wexe2x80x99re just concentrating on athletes that are popular here in the northeast. Of course, thatxe2x80x99s not a mandate.n
Darryl: xe2x80x9cMandatexe2x80x9d- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friendsxe2x80xa6 I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar?n
Jim: Mm-hmn
Athlead Employee: Alright, so what makes you think youxe2x80x99d be a good fit here?n
Darryl: [freezes] Ummmxe2x80xa6 [a moment later] Alright. Obviously yxe2x80x99all look really busy, and uh, I donxe2x80x99t want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhhxe2x80xa6 Obviously Ixe2x80x99m not qualified to be here man, Ixe2x80x99mxe2x80xa6  Ixe2x80x99m a warehouse manager, you knowxe2x80xa6n
Athlead Employee: Darryl, I was a newspaper editor.n
Female Athlead Employee: Science teacher, volleyball coach.n
3rd Athlead Employee: I work at a home shopping network.n
4th Athlead Employee: Ixe2x80x99m a laywer. Ixe2x80x99m the only one here who can honestly help. [group chuckles]n
Jim: And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles]n
Darryl: Cool. Hey, thanksxe2x80xa6n
Athlead Employee: So how about we start over, hmm? Darryl, do you have any thoughts on the company?n
Pete: [to Erin] Stocking pens, huh? Youxe2x80x99re like the new office administrator.n
Erin: No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but itxe2x80x99s the truth, I swear.n
Kevin: Pam! Pam, look out! Erinxe2x80x99s gunning for your job!n
Erin: No, Ixe2x80x99m not! [Kevin imitates gunfire] Itxe2x80x99s not like that at all! Forget it, Ixe2x80x99m so sorry.n
Kevin: Pam, look out!n
Athlead Employee: By the way, Jim talks about you all the time.n
Pam: Thatxe2x80x99s sweet that he talks about me.n
Athlead Employee: Itxe2x80x99s too bad he still hast to work part time in Scranton thoughxe2x80xa6n
Pam: Well, thatxe2x80x99s funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.n
Suit Store Son: Ixe2x80x99m sorry, you guys are here to sell us paper?n
Dwight: Do you mind? The men are talking.n
Suit Store Father: Sons used to idolize their fathers.n
Dwight: Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?n
Suit Store Father: Ixe2x80x99d love to! Sam Junior here, he runs the business now. Kind of pushed me out, truth be told. Ixe2x80x99m just here for human contract.n
Suit Store Son: Okay Popxe2x80xa6n
Dwight: Wait, so youxe2x80x99re the boss?n
Suit Store Son: Thatxe2x80x99s right.n
Clark: Hi, Ixe2x80x99m Clark.n
Suit Store Son: Hey.n
Clark: Letxe2x80x99s talk.n
Suit Store Son: Okay.n
Athlead Employee: Well, thanks for coming down Darryl.n
Female Athlead Employee: It was nice meeting you Darryl, I think youxe2x80x99d fit in great here.n
Pam: Theyxe2x80x99re the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. Itxe2x80x99s like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I donxe2x80x99t blame Cece.n
Darryl: So Ixe2x80x99m like a three year old girl in this scenarioxe2x80xa6n
Pam: Say they donxe2x80x99t hire you. Itxe2x80x99s not like youxe2x80x99re out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.n
Darryl: And Ixe2x80x99d only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, Ixe2x80x99mxe2x80xa6 Ixe2x80x99m not so sure Ixe2x80x99d like living in Philadelphia.n
Pam: Right? Thank you! Itxe2x80x99s just Philly. Everyonexe2x80x99s acting like itxe2x80x99s New York or Paris or London.n
Darryl: Who needs it?n
Pam: Not us.n
Jim: [enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. Theyxe2x80x99re going to make you pay for the fish, andxe2x80xa6 they wanted to know when you can start.n
Darryl: What? [Jim shrugs] How about yesterday?n
Pam: Congratulations.n
Darryl: Oh, thank you.n
Pam: I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.n
Kevin: It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.n
Oscar: Itxe2x80x99s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!n
Clark: I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dadxe2x80x99s suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. Thatxe2x80x99s why his face always breaks out.n
Suit Store Son: Does that suit come with a fire extinguisher? [Clark chuckles]n
Clark: You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, Ixe2x80x99m going to need one right? If Ixe2x80x99m ever going to get a xe2x80x9creal jobxe2x80x9d and move my xe2x80x9clazy assxe2x80x9d out of your xe2x80x9cG.D. housexe2x80x9d.n
Suit Store Son: [to Clark in dressing room] Thatxe2x80x99s Italian silk. Very comfortable. Very tastefulxe2x80xa6 Although expensive.n
Dwight: Yeah, you donxe2x80x99t want Italian. Youxe2x80x99ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, youxe2x80x99ll be doing life in Rikers Island.n
Clark: Well, thatxe2x80x99s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.n
Dwight: That place doesnxe2x80x99t exist. Itxe2x80x99s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?n
Clark: [emerges from dressing room wearing a sharp black suit] How do I look?n
Oscar: Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why donxe2x80x99t we move the copier into the annex like wexe2x80x99ve always wanted to?n
Nellie: Whoo!n
Meredith: Frickinxe2x80x99 A!n
Oscar: Huh?n
Kevin: So long, noise!n
Oscar: One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath]n
Nellie: And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, wexe2x80x99re going to be in so much trouble!n
Oscar: Wait! [looking at the hardwood floor beneath the carpet] Itxe2x80x99s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.n
Meredith: Tear up the carpet!n
Darryl: Kill their fish, and they still hire me. Thatxe2x80x99s how you do that, baby. Itxe2x80x99s all good, Ixe2x80x99m ready. Yxe2x80x99all ready for this? [sings intro to xe2x80x9cEverybody dance nowxe2x80x9d, points to Pam to sing first line]n
Oscar: Kevin, move. I canxe2x80x99t pull up the rug if youxe2x80x99re standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.n
Kevin: Well I canxe2x80x99t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.n
Angela: Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?n
Nellie: Oh, enough with the whining already! Why donxe2x80x99t you just have some more coffee?n
Stanley: Itxe2x80x99s all gone. I didnxe2x80x99t get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.n
Creed: I saw the leaves twitch!n
Angela: Shut up!n
Creed: You shut up!n
Oscar: Everybody shut up and work!n
Phyllis: We donxe2x80x99t work for you!n
Kevin: Yeah!n
Angela: Yeah!n
Stanley: Hey, itxe2x80x99s five oxe2x80x99clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot]n
Oscar: [with horns honking] Kevin, can-n
Dwight: Yes! We did it! [leaving the suit store]n
Clark: You opened the door-n
Dwight: And you closed it. The boys are back in town. [high fives Clark] High fives! Ha ha!n
Clark: Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?n
Dwight: You got me! [tickles Clark and chuckles] I used to collect them!n
Clark: Why?n
Pam: [shocked after seeing the torn up carpet] Heyxe2x80xa6 What happened here?n
Erin: You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. Thatxe2x80x99s what happened. The pens happened.n
Pam: xe2x80xa6Are the pens here?n</div>]
