Gabe: Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.n
Gabe: I remember when people thought biceps were all that. Theyxe2x80x99d flex them all night at the discotheque.n
Dwight: Oh, I bet you think itxe2x80x99s all about core, huh?n
Gabe: Yeah.n
Dwight: Oh, please.n
Gabe: Corexe2x80x99s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One xe2x80x93 lengthen. Two xe2x80x93 elongate.n
Jim: All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.n
Dwight: Feast on this, Lewis.n
Gabe: I love the burn. The burn is where I live.n
Jim: Come on, Gabe, you canxe2x80x99t handle his hamstrings. Youxe2x80x99re getting hypno-thigh-zed.n
Gabe: Speed set. One. Two.n
Jim: Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.n
Dwight: Oh, thank you.n
Jim: Youxe2x80x99re welcome.n
Gabe: Five. Six.n
Jim: Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,n
All: Eight, nine, ten.n
Dwight: Very funny Jim.n
Gabe: Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.n
Robert: Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over] n
Jim: All right, easy there, grandpa.n
Dwight: I donxe2x80x99t need your help.n
Jim: Okay. You donxe2x80x99t need my help?n
Andy: Morning.n
Erin: Hey.n
Andy: Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgotxe2x80xa6 these.n
Erin: Oh.n
Andy: You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.n
Erin: Andy, if youxe2x80x99re gonna hang out for a while, uhxe2x80xa6n
Andy: Whatxe2x80x99s this?n
Erin: This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.n
Andy: Is this Robertxe2x80x99s attempt to embarrass me?n
Jim: All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.n
Dwight: Good, we have a deal?n
Jim: Thanks Janet.n
Dwight: Thanks so much Earl.n
Jim: Wow, simultaneous sale.n
Dwight: And they said it couldnxe2x80x99t be done. Boom!n
Jim: Screw xe2x80x98em.n
Andy: Lot going on guys. Whatxe2x80x99s happening?n
Jim: Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.n
Andy: That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. Itxe2x80x99s like a festival of poo.n
Jim: Hey, hey, come on, language.n
Dwight: Yeah, and wexe2x80x99re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.n
Jim: In the fridge.n
Dwight: No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.n
Jim: Sorry, man, I canxe2x80x99t focus on zingers. Therexe2x80x99s too many potential clients.n
Stanley: You two better watch yourselves.n
Phyllis: Yeah, the Syracuse branch canxe2x80x99t be happy youxe2x80x99re taking New York clients.n
Robert: Shhxe2x80xa6 shhxe2x80xa6 [vomits in trash can]n
Jim: Robert?n
Oscar: Why did Binghamton close?n
Robert: Can everyone just, pleasexe2x80xa6 I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and xe2x80x93 how should I say this xe2x80x93 Columbian whites. What xe2x80x93 what is this about, uh, Binghamton?n
Nellie: I got your voicemail. From xe2x80x93 from last night.n
Robert: Wonderful.n
Nellie: And the answerxe2x80xa6 is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]n
Robert: Pam, whenxe2x80x99s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldnxe2x80x99t hold the memories in?n
Pam: Oh, it was this summer xe2x80x93n
Robert: Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.n
Pam: Um, I am a little busy.n
Robert: Yes, xe2x80x98course. Why donxe2x80x99t you list the things that would keep you from helping me.n
Pam: Yeah, I can make you a list.n
Robert: Letxe2x80x99s do it now. Whatxe2x80x99s number one?n
Pam: Why donxe2x80x99t I help you now?n
Robert: There we go.n
Pam: Okay.n</div>, <div class="quote">n[Andy cooking food by reception, Harry walks in]n
Harry: Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute?n
Erin: Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?n
Dwight: And you arexe2x80xa6n
Harry: Harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse. n
[shocked look from Jim]n
Harry: What the hellxe2x80x99s all this?n
Andy: Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.n
Jim: The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.n
Dwight: Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to xe2x80x93 how do I put this xe2x80x93 steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.n
Jim: Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.n
Dwight: Yes.n
Dwight: [pointing at Toby] There he is. Thatxe2x80x99s Lloyd.n
Toby: Me?n
Harry: Where do you get off crossing state lines?n
Harry: Theyxe2x80x99re New York. Wexe2x80x99re New York. State line is the dividing line. That's the way itxe2x80x99s always been.n
Jim: Therexe2x80x99s actually not a rule that says that.n
Dwight: Thatxe2x80x99s true.n
Toby: Thatxe2x80x99s true. Therexe2x80x99s no rule. You can check the employee handbook.n
Harry: Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?n
Toby: No.n
Dwight: Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I couldxe2x80x99ve choked so many people by now.n
Harry: Stay out of my state. Itxe2x80x99s in your best interest to stay out of my state.n
Toby: Ixe2x80x99ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.n
Harry: Just stay out of New York, Lloyd.n
Toby: Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]n
Jim: How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?n
Harry: Robertxe2x80x99s here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I donxe2x80x99t think we were doing that.n
Robert: Wherexe2x80x99s the Advil, Jim? I think Ixe2x80x99ve hit my limit on the Tylenol xe2x80x93 Oh.n
Andy: [Doing dishes] Sorry, not Jim.n
Robert: Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?n
Andy: Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.n
Robert: Oh, for god xe2x80x93n
Harry: Robert California. What a surprise youxe2x80x99re here in Scranton.n
Robert: Harryxe2x80xa6n
Harry: So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place?n
Robert: How do you mean?n
Andy: I forgot, axe2x80xa6 a pan, uh xe2x80x93n
Harry: No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.n
Robert: Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. Therexe2x80x99s no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seemsxe2x80xa6 so poorly timed.n
Dwight: Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.n
Harry: Listen, Robert, I donxe2x80x99t have time. Therexe2x80x99s a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions xe2x80x93n
Dwight: Donxe2x80x99t listen to him.n
Harry: Used to be Binghamtonxe2x80x99s xe2x80x93n
Dwight: Nope.n
Harry: I want it, itxe2x80x99s mine.n
Dwight: Prestige is ours. Okay, theyxe2x80x99re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.n
Harry: We need you to make a decision.n
Dwight: Make a decision.n
Harry: Is it just me or is our boss a freakinxe2x80x99 weirdo? [stands up, walks outside] Ixe2x80x99m gonna get some air.n
Dwight: Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.n
Jim: [Gets up and looks out Nelliexe2x80x99s office window] Hexe2x80x99s running!n
Dwight: Damn it!n
Dwight: Wha xe2x80x93 what is this supposed to be?n
Jim: Itxe2x80x99s a monkey.n
Dwight: Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. Itxe2x80x99s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.n
Jim: Hold on, hold on. Is this him?n
Dwight: What?n
Jim: Is that him?n
Dwight: Itxe2x80x99s him! Do something! Get out!n

Nellie: Oh. Oh, Ixe2x80x99ll tell you what he does.n
Angela:: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.n
Gabe: Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? Ixe2x80x99m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.n
Nellie: Do you think Ixe2x80x99d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?n
Andy: Ixe2x80x99m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.n
Mr. Ramish: Why havenxe2x80x99t I heard of you? You got any references?n
Andy: No. Ixe2x80x99m a rogue.n
Mr. Ramish: Uh-huh.n
Andy: Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Nowxe2x80xa6 [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.n
Mr. Ramish: Every salesman Ixe2x80x99ve ever met has given me his personal phone number.n
Andy: Of course they have. Which is why Ixe2x80x99m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need xe2x80x93 anytime, night or day xe2x80x93 you just stop on by.n
Mr. Ramish: You want me to drive to your house if I need paper.n

Jim: Big Red Paper Company?n
Harry: Give me a cup of coffee.n
Dwight: Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?n
Jim: All right, guys. It didnxe2x80x99t work out for any of us, soxe2x80xa6 wexe2x80x99re still on the same team. Let me get these.n
Dwight: No. Let him get his own. Itxe2x80x99s Syracuse money.n
Harry: You know, your partnerxe2x80x99s got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?n

Robert: Now we get to the bottom of Nelliexe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cyes, yes, yes, yes, never.xe2x80x9dn
Phone: Hi, Nell, itxe2x80x99s mom. Do keep your chin up. It canxe2x80x99t be as bad as you described.n
Robert: Oh yes it can.n
Phone: This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections.n
Robert: Shopaholic.n
Pam: Sounds like it.n
Robert: Yeah.n
Phone: Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you?n
Robert: Ah.n
Phone: This is Annie from second nests. Ixe2x80x99m sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, wexe2x80x99re gonna hold out for that.n
Pam: Okay, thatxe2x80x99s enough. [grabs phone]n
Robert: Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.n
Pam: No, no, no!n

Nellie: Oh, god, Pam. Donxe2x80x99t get me started.n
Pam: No, I will not.n
Nellie: Youxe2x80x99ve just got me started. Robertxe2x80xa6 isxe2x80xa6 a filthy beast. I mean, donxe2x80x99t you get the feeling, hexe2x80x99s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?n
Pam: Well xe2x80x93n
Nellie: I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.n
Pam: But sometimes he talks about fleshxe2x80xa6 and bacchanals. n
Nellie: I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.n
Pam: Noxe2x80xa6 donxe2x80x99t. Just put it out of your mind.n

Erin: He says salvation. No last name.n
Robert: Yeah, hello?n

Robert: Youxe2x80x99re blackmailing me.n
Andy: Itxe2x80x99s just business.n
Robert: Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. Youxe2x80x99re gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You donxe2x80x99t even know my real name. Ixe2x80x99m the *bleep* lizard king. [disconnects]n
Andy: Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]n
David: [opens door] Andy Bernard.n
Andy: You got a minute?n
David: Umxe2x80xa6 Ixe2x80x99m in the middle of a piano lesson.n
Andy: I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.n
David: Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Nowxe2x80xa6 why would I want that? Itxe2x80x99s worth half of what it was three years ago.n
Andy: Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.n
Harry: So what would you do if you werenxe2x80x99t selling paper?n
Jim: Oh, man, Ixe2x80x99d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.n
Dwight: What?n
Jim: Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.n
Dwight: How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You donxe2x80x99t even care about nationals.n
Harry: Nothing?n
Jim: I donxe2x80x99t know. Ixe2x80x99ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?n
Harry: Ixe2x80x99d like to sell one big thing, you know? Likexe2x80xa6 a plane. One sale, Ixe2x80x99m out.n
Jim: That sounds lovely.n
Harry: Anyway, Robertxe2x80x99s gonna run this company into the ground, soxe2x80xa6 We wonxe2x80x99t be doing this in six months.n</div>]
