Oscar: Good morning. [clears throat]n
Angela: Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question?n
Oscar: [whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- xc2xa0questions.n
Angela: Is it cool in here to you?n
Oscar: [hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.n
Angela: I think the thermostat is acting up again.n
Oscar: Itxe2x80x99s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So Ixe2x80x99m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. Ixe2x80x99ll just go downstairs.n
Angela: Thank you.n
Dwight: Well, well, well, itxe2x80x99s finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.n
Pam: These are my painting clothes.I think Ixe2x80x99m gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. [Jim applauds]n
Meredith: Sure you donxe2x80x99t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.n
Jim: You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?n
Pam: Are you avoiding your phone call?n
Jim: Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there. n
Pam: Last week Jim wasnxe2x80x99t there, and they named the company Athlead.n
Jim: I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace. n
Pam: Tell them your opening line.n
Jim: [sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy whoxe2x80x99s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?n
Pam: I think itxe2x80x99s good. He likes fishing.n
Angela: [upon seeing Dwight naked] Ugh!n
Dwight: Come on in, the waterxe2x80x99s fine. n
Angela: Dwight, itxe2x80x99s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on. n
Dwight: I know. Thatxe2x80x99s not why Ixe2x80x99m naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks]n
Angela: Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.n
Dwight: Oh, Ixe2x80x99m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If Ixe2x80x99m not in your panties, I donxe2x80x99t go vigilantes. Why donxe2x80x99t you ask your husband?n
Angela: My marriage is in danger. I donxe2x80x99t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me. n
Dwight: [sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?n
Angela: xc2xa0Something like that.n
Dwight: Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force. n
Angela: Can you arrange a meeting?n
Dwight: I can try. Ixe2x80x99m gonna use SMS text.n
Angela: Okay.n
Dwight: Text went through. n
Angela: Okay.n
Dwight: All we can do is sit and wait. n
Angela: Okay.n
Jim: I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly. n
David: [on phone] Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If therexe2x80x99s a crisis -- the more I think about it -- n
Jim: Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while Ixe2x80x99m gone.n
David: They did?n
Jim: Yep.n
David: Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work. n
Stanley: Why should we help you?n
Jim: Because wexe2x80x99re friends.n
Stanley: When is my birthday?n
Jim: Unfair. Whenxe2x80x99s my birthday?n
Stanley: I donxe2x80x99t know, because wexe2x80x99re not friends. n
Jim: How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?n
Stanley: Now wexe2x80x99re talkinxe2x80x99.n
Jim: All right.n
Kevin: Make it go taller.n
Pete: Thatxe2x80x99s the idea.n
Kevin: No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]n
Pete: Well, Ixe2x80x99ve gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.n
Kevin: Youxe2x80x99re not getting this, Peter. xc2xa0Make it go wider... up!n
Pete: Will do.n
Darryl: [entering] What are yxe2x80x99all doing?n
Kevin: Me and Pete are building a tower. n
Darryl: Cool. It should be taller though, right?n
Kevin: Obviously. Hexe2x80x99s a sweet kid, Darryl. But hexe2x80x99s not the sharpest guy in the drawer. n
Pete: Kevin, I can hear you.n
Angela: Ow! Dwight! Ow!n
Dwight: Get in the van.n
Angela: God!n
Trevor: Is it safe to talk?n
Dwight: Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I donxe2x80x99t see them so I think wexe2x80x99re good.n
Angela: So what are your credentials?n
Trevor: I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out, Ixe2x80x99m damn good at it. n
Angela: Do you have a gun?n
Dwight: [snickers] Does he own a gun? Show her.n
Trevor: You tell me.n
Angela: What is this?n
Trevor: Itxe2x80x99s the receipt for my gun.n
Angela: You donxe2x80x99t carry it with you?n
Trevor: Read the receipt. Thatxe2x80x99s a $300 gun. Someone could steal it. n
Dwight: Do you have any idea how many guns Trevorxe2x80x99s had stolen from him?n
Trevor: Now I keep it in a safe.n
Dwight: Mm-hmm. Good safe?n
Trevor: Oh, you tell me. [shows Dwight receipt]n
Pam: [studying mural wall] I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. Itxe2x80x99s just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, Ixe2x80x99m gonna limit myself to one shrub. n
Hide: You paint wall now?n
Pam: Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that... n
Hide: You paint now.n
Pam: Itxe2x80x99s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing. n
Meredith: Sweet.n
Erin: Yay!n
Darryl: Thatxe2x80x99s what Ixe2x80x99m talkinxe2x80x99 about.n
Pete: This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote xe2x80x98sausage factory.xe2x80x99n
Meredith: Oh OOOH!n
Everyone: [approving cheers]n
Meredith: Boom!n
Darryl: Bang.n
Kevin: Yep, yep, yep.n
Pete: All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.n
Creed: Letxe2x80x99s find out what I did.n
Dwight: You get half now and half upon completion of said job. n
Trevor: And thatxe2x80x99s all off the books?n
Angela: Obviously.n
Trevor: Nice. No taxes. n
Angela: Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here. n
Trevor: So whatxe2x80x99s the job?n
Angela: Murder.n
Dwight: You canxe2x80x99t have someone murdered.n
Angela: What if they deserved it? n
Dwight: What did they do to you, Angela?n
Angela: Theyxe2x80x99re sleeping with my husband. n
Dwight: Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you. n
Trevor: This seems a little crazy.n
Dwight: Yes. Crazy. Thank you.n
Trevor: But I think Ixe2x80x99m up for it. n
Dwight: No! No!n
Angela: Thank you.n
Dwight: Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. Ixe2x80x99ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch-- n
Trevor: Thatxe2x80x99s very effective. Ixe2x80x99ve been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. Itxe2x80x99s devastating.n
Angela: No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer. n
Trevor: What about a knee-capping?n
Dwight: No! Youxe2x80x99re not helping, Trevor!n
Angela: Yes, a knee-capping could work. n
Dwight: No. Angela! What are you saying? n
Angela: You said you would be there for me. n
Dwight: Ixe2x80x99m trying, but what youxe2x80x99re asking is-- n
Angela: Itxe2x80x99s the only thing that will make this right. n
Dwight: Okay. But itxe2x80x99s cruel, because a woman with damaged knees canxe2x80x99t scrub worth a damn. n
Jim: You know, truth be told, I think all youxe2x80x99ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while Ixe2x80x99m gone. n
Stanley: Wexe2x80x99ve got all afternoon to talk about that. n
Waiter: Morning, folks.n
Stanley: Ixe2x80x99ll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster. n
Waiter: Actually, the surf and turf does come with lob--n
Stanley: Not enough lobster. Side order. n
Oscar: I brought you a cookie. n
Pete: There we go.n
Everyone: [cheers and applause]n
Pete: Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex. n
Nellie: Oooohh... you salty dog.n
Darryl: Well, yeah, what can I say, a playerxe2x80x99s gotta play. n
Kevin: Okay, I got this one. n
Nellie: Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be carefuln
Kevin: No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath. n
Everyone: [shouting as tower collapses] Oh no! Kevin!n
Nellie: What did I just say? What did I just say?n
Pete: Hey, hey, hey, itxe2x80x99s just a mistake. Just a mistake. Thatxe2x80x99s what this towerxe2x80x99s all about -- xc2xa0mistakes. Okay, if youxe2x80x99re afraid of screwing up, the towerxe2x80x99s not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? Thatxe2x80x99s right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Letxe2x80x99s get back to work, huh? Come on, you in? n
Kevin: Yeah. n
Jim: You know, at the end of the day, itxe2x80x99s really only two days. I mean, Ixe2x80x99ll be back in the office. xc2xa0If you need me for an emergency, call me. xc2xa0Ixe2x80x99ll be there...n
Phyllis: You know what? I donxe2x80x99t know where the years went. xc2xa0xe2x80x98Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I donxe2x80x99t even recognize them. n
Jim: Tell me about it.n
Phyllis: Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I donxe2x80x99t know. n
Jim: All right. You know what? xc2xa0Maybe wexe2x80x99ll just... Wexe2x80x99ll go slow.n
Pete: All right. Check it out.n
Everyone: [cheers and applause]n
Pete: Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh! n
Kevin: Nice. xc2xa0Pretty soon, wexe2x80x99re gonna be at the ceiling. n
Erin: Whoo!n
Pete: Can you hand me a card?n
Erin: Um,. itxe2x80x99s empty. n
Pete: What?n
Nellie: Oh, come on. We could use a blank card. n
Everyone: No!!n
Meredith: Thatxe2x80x99s cheating.n
Pam: I could get us a complaint. n
Meredith: You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldnxe2x80x99t fart on a butterfly.n
Pam: No, I wouldnxe2x80x99t. I canxe2x80x99t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. Ixe2x80x99d like to try. n
Nellie: Hmm. Yeah. xc2xa0All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam... n
Angela: What? Why did you call me out here?n
Dwight: The target-- itxe2x80x99s Oscar, isnxe2x80x99t it? He and the senator are gaying each other. n
Angela: I donxe2x80x99t know what youxe2x80x99re talking about.n
Dwight: Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time youxe2x80x99re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils. n
Angela: Fine! Itxe2x80x99s Oscar. So what? n
Dwight: Well I could understand you wanting to get a strangerxe2x80x99s knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?n
Angela: Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband. n
Dwight: I canxe2x80x99t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me. n
Angela: Well, you might be right. But itxe2x80x99s too late now. n
Dwight: What do you mean?n
Angela: Hexe2x80x99s here. n
Dwight: Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.n
Oscar: What? n
Dwight: Come -- come with me.n
Oscar: What are you doing?n
Dwight: There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. Theyxe2x80x99re extraordinary. n
Meredith: Yahtzee.n
Trevor: Sandwich delivery for Mr. Oscar Martinez. n
Kevin: I am Oscar Martinez. n
Angela: No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside. n
Kevin: Wha-- wh--n
Angela: You know, therexe2x80x99s doughnuts in the break room. n
Jim: Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over. n
Stanley: Donxe2x80x99t be pushy Jim. Itxe2x80x99s tacky. n
Jim: All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, thatxe2x80x99s-- thatxe2x80x99s decorative. n
Phyllis: No, therexe2x80x99s wine in here. n
Jim: Still decorative.n
Stanley: Is it white wine? n
Jim: No.n
Phyllis: [to customer] Can you help me? n
Jim: Donxe2x80x99t-- donxe2x80x99t-- donxe2x80x99t pole people with knives. n
Phyllis: [groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!n
Jim: Phyllis! xc2xa0Wow. n
Stanley: Ooh, bring it over.n
Dwight: Therexe2x80x99s no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps. n
Oscar: Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you? n
Dwight: What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man whoxe2x80x99s the father of her child? n
Oscar: I donxe2x80x99t know what youxe2x80x99re talking about.n
Dwight: Aah! Actually, hexe2x80x99s right in front of us. n
Trevor: Letxe2x80x99s get it on. Ixe2x80x99m gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but Ixe2x80x99m gonna do this. n
Dwight: No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. Hexe2x80x99s a Dunder-Mifflin man. Hexe2x80x99s my tribe. n
Trevor: Ixe2x80x99m sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, Ixe2x80x99m gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- Stop! No!n
Oscar: I got it. n
Dwight: Disarm!n
Trevor: You donxe2x80x99t-- [all three grunting]n
Dwight: Donxe2x80x99t move. And disarm now! [Oscar gets weapon away from others]n
Trevor: Okay, okay, okay, okay. n
Erin: Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. Theyxe2x80x99re family-owned, but donxe2x80x99t let that take away from your edge! n
Nellie: Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you. n
Creed: Remember, youxe2x80x99re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this. n
Pam: [into phone] Hello, this is Pam Halpert. Ixe2x80x99m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, xe2x80x9cHey, kool-aid.xe2x80x9d Yeah, your mamaxe2x80x99s fat. This is Pam Halpert. n
Pete: Did she buy it?n
Pam: Basically I couldnxe2x80x99t tell, but I think... n
Nellie: Were they angry?n
Pam: I-- I thought they were confused at least...n
Nellie: Okay.n
[phone rings]n
Erin: Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. [hangs up] Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client! n
Everyone: [cheering]n
Kevin: Nice. Nice. n
Creed: You did good. You did good.n
Dwight: No.n
Trevor: If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend. n
Oscar: What the hell, Dwight?n
Dwight: See ya later, Trevor.n
Oscar: you are incorrigible!n
Dwight: I just saved your life. Youxe2x80x99re welcome! n
Oscar: You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!n
Angela: You deserved every bit of it! xc2xa0You made my husband gay. n
Oscar: What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him! n
Angela: No. No.n
Oscar: Angela, until you face that, youxe2x80x99re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I wonxe2x80x99t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me. n
Angela: Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you. n
Oscar: Angela, itxe2x80x99s a lead freaking pipe. n
Angela: God! [kicks Oscar]n
Oscar: Aah!n
Angela: You were supposed to be my friend. n
Oscar: Ixe2x80x99m so sorry. Angela--n
Pete: Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert... n
Everyone: [cheers and applause]n
Pete: For insulting a clientxe2x80x99s recently deceased mother. n
Nellie: Yes!n
Pam: I did not know that. n
Pete: Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life. n
Pam: Ixe2x80x99m so sorry.n
Meredith: Wow. n
Pete: yeah. Thatxe2x80x99s-- that is terrible. n
Everyone: [cheers and applause as Pete puts last card on tower]n
Kevin: You did it.n
Angela: I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day. n
Dwight: Youxe2x80x99re not stupid. Jazz is stupid. n
Angela: [crying] Jazz is stupid! xc2xa0I mean, just play the right notes! n
Dwight: I know. Youxe2x80x99re gonna be okay, Monkey. n
Angela: I donxe2x80x99t like your friend Trevor. n
Jim: Well, wexe2x80x99re here. Perfect. xc2xa0[covers sleeping Phyllis with his jacket]n
Phyllis: Wexe2x80x99re gonna cover for you, ya know.n
Stanley: [chuckles]n
Jim: Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--n
Stanley: [laughing] I did enjoy grinding your beans, son. n
Phyllis: [laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes. n
Jim: This is hilarious, but wexe2x80x99re gonna stop with all-- n
Stanley: Shuckinxe2x80x99 your peas.n
Jim: Shuckinxe2x80x99 the peas. xc2xa0You should go back to the first part, though. You are xc2xa0gonna xc2xa0cover for me? n
Stanley: Yeah.n
Phyllis: Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys. n
Pam: If youxe2x80x99re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea xc2xa0that you canxe2x80x99t please everybody all the time. n
Hide: You paint very bad--n
Dwight: Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted? n
Toby: That is-- that is a loaded question. n
Angela: My pastor said it can come from breast feeding. n
Toby: He said that?n
Angela: Well, he didnxe2x80x99t fight me hard on it. n
Toby: I-- I donxe2x80x99t know if therexe2x80x99s truth to-- to, uh, to that. n
Angela: What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet? n
Toby: Oh... uh...n
Angela: Is it called red-vining? n
Dwight: Is it called red-vining?n
Toby: I donxe2x80x99t...n
Dwight: We heard it was called red-vining.n
Angela: People red vine.n
Dwight: Where are gay mensxe2x80x99 vaginas?n
Toby: They donxe2x80x99t have vaginas.n
Dwight: What?n
Toby: No. Theyxe2x80x99re just regular men. n
Dwight: When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other personxe2x80x99s penis?n
Toby: Uh... wow....n</div>]
