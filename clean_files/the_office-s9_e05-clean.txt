Dwight: Dumatril.n
Nellie: Yes?n
Dwight: This is a pill that I found here in the office. But itxe2x80x99s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. Itxe2x80x99s not for any disorder of the body. [whispering] Itxe2x80x99s for a disorder of the mind.n
Nellie: The mind is part of the body.n
Dwight: Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... [whispering] They are now off their meds.n
Nellie: Dwight, our co-workersxe2x80x99 health issues are really none of our business so-n
Dwight: Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? Whatxe2x80x99s going on Nellie? Talk to me.n

[awkward silence]n
Andy: You donxe2x80x99t have any-- Any questions about the old days? [clears throat] You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ?n
HCT Member #2: I thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ.n
Andy: Ixe2x80x99m sorry, what?n
HCT Member #2: I just thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ.n
Pete: I didnxe2x80x99t realize that everybody here dresses up every year.n
Andy: I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that youxe2x80x99re Boner Champ.n
Broccoli Rob: [on computer monitor] Ixe2x80x99m so sorry! I donxe2x80x99t know how that could have happened.n
Andy: Did you maybe tell them that or...?n
Broccoli Rob: I just-- I just started yappinxe2x80x99 about the old days, and I guess the wine coolers were flowing, and, you know, somehow things just got hinky.n
Andy: Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know itxe2x80x99s really stupid, but itxe2x80x99s also really, really, really important.n
Broccoli Rob: Will do. I love you, Andy.n

Businessman #3: Welcome aboard!n
Dwight: Hi Daryl. Ixe2x80x99m just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.n
Nellie: You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.n
Dwight: That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?n
Darryl: I canxe2x80x99t really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.n
Dwight: So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?n
Darryl: Get under your chin first. Yeah.n

Senator Lipton: Nice to see you Oscar.n
Angela: Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!n
Senator Lipton: So Oscar, youxe2x80x99re a dinosaur.n
Oscar: Actually Ixe2x80x99m the electoral college.n
Senator Lipton: Ouch! Right on target.n

Senator Lipton: God, itxe2x80x99s just so good to see you.n
Oscar: I, uh, huh, just [chuckles nervously]n

Erin: What is with these turkeys?n
Erin: Hey! You better do xe2x80x98Faith.xe2x80x99 You get me?n

Dwight: All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.n
Nellie: Okay, look Dwight, letxe2x80x99s just call this thing off. I mean, itxe2x80x99s just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.n
Dwight: You think I donxe2x80x99t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes Ixe2x80x99ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And nexe2x80x99er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I donxe2x80x99t need some stupid pill to get me through all this.n
Meredith: Cool. Free upper.n

Pam: Did everybody end up investing ten thousand?n
Jim: Um, oh man, I donxe2x80x99t actually know.n
Pam: What?n
Jim: They werenxe2x80x99t really talking that much about money. They just said, Wexe2x80x99re good with investing and then I...and I...n
Andy: Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!n
HCT: [vocalizing]n
Pam: They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?n
Jim: No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.n
Pam: So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?n
Jim: You werenxe2x80x99t there.n
HCT: [singing xe2x80x98Ixe2x80x99ll Bexe2x80x99]n
Jim: It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.n
HCT: [singing xe2x80x98Ixe2x80x99ll Bexe2x80x99 directly to Pam]n
Pam: Talk about it now.n

HCT: Thank you.n
Stanley: Show some pride. This is crap.n
Dwight: I agree. Yes, crap. Continue.n
HCT Member #3: Now folks, by special request, wexe2x80x99re going to take it a little old school. There is a former Trebler in this room.n
Darryl: Who?n
HCT Member #3: Itxe2x80x99s Mr. Andy Bernard!n
All: [clapping]n
HCT: [singing xe2x80x98Faithxe2x80x99]n
Andy: No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...n
HCT Member #3: He reminded us today of how much he means to us. And we certainly seem to mean a lot to him, so without any further ado, herexe2x80x99s an old Treble classic.n
HCT: [singing xe2x80x98Faithxe2x80x99]n
Broccoli Rob: [on flat screen tv] [singing lead of Faith]  n
Andy: Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here?n
HCT Member #3: She said you wanted to hear xe2x80x98Faithxe2x80x99. Thatxe2x80x99s Broccoli Robxe2x80x99s signature song.n
Andy: Thatxe2x80x99s my signature song.n
HCT Member #3: I really didnxe2x80x99t know that man. I just thought you wanted to hear it.n
Andy: Russell, Ixe2x80x99m dressed like George Michael.n
HCT Member #3: I thought you were Adam Lambert.n
Erin: Are you okay?n
Broccoli Rob: [on screen] Hexe2x80x99s still mad.n
Andy: Shut up, Broccoli.n
Broccoli Rob: Champ, I feel awful about this whole thing. Russell called me up. And they said they needed 20 ccxe2x80x99s of George Michael stat. So just... Wham! I sprang into action. You know me. I assumed you wanted to hear me do your signature number.n
Andy: You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A manxe2x80x99s signature solo is his for life, okay? Thatxe2x80x99s group policy and you know it.n
Broccoli Rob: Look, itxe2x80x99s not my fault that I still live near campus, and itxe2x80x99s my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys., and stop in two, three times a week.n
Andy: Just donxe2x80x99t do the song anymore.n
Broccoli Rob: I tell you what, wexe2x80x99ll have a sing-off for it. You pick twelve alums from any year to back you up and Ixe2x80x99ll do the same, and Ixe2x80x99m so confident that Ixe2x80x99ll win, I wonxe2x80x99t even warm up.n
Andy: Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes.n
Broccoli Rob: My pipes are primo, Champ. Why donxe2x80x99t you ask Trey Anastasio about my pipes?n
Andy: I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!n
Broccoli Rob: He said, and I quote, xe2x80x98Hey Rob, nice pipesxe2x80x99. That happened!n
Andy: OK, fine, yeah. thatxe2x80x99s one guyxe2x80x99s opinion!n
Broccoli Rob: That's real.  'Thatxe2x80x99ll never change!n
Erin: Okay!n
Jim: I thought that concert was pretty great.n
Kevin: Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.n
Angela: They lost me when they sang xe2x80x98Monster Mashxe2x80x99. That song obviously glorifies the occult.n
Jim: Angela, itxe2x80x99s Halloween. You have to sing xe2x80x98Monster Mashxe2x80x99.n
Pam: Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?n
Jim: Uh...n
Pam: No Ixe2x80x99m just, Ixe2x80x99m saying, what would happen if they didnxe2x80x99t sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?n
Jim: Okay. Wexe2x80x99ll, just forget it.n
Pam: No! No, Ixe2x80x99m interested. I mean I think everybodyxe2x80x99s interested in why they have to sing it.n
Jim: Because it is Halloween. So if youxe2x80x99re going to sing a concert, itxe2x80x99s a good idea to throw that one in.n
Andy: This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?n
Erin: [laughing] Yeah.n
Andy: I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?n
Erin: Oh well, Andy, wexe2x80x99re not moving to Cornell.n
Andy: Duh. I know. That would be insane.n
Erin: Yeah.n
Andy: It could totally work though. I donxe2x80x99t know why we wouldnxe2x80x99t. Oh my god are we doing this?n
Erin: Oy. Andy, whatxe2x80x99s going on?n
Andy: If I am not Boner Champ, I donxe2x80x99t know who I am.n
Erin: Well, um, you know maybe youxe2x80x99re the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--n
Andy: Make a donation.n
Erin: Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.n
Andy: Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.n
Dwight:[whispering] I want some of those pills.n
Nellie: Oh, well good for you. I mean, youxe2x80x99ll need a prescription.n
Dwight: Oh, no. No, no, no. no. Theyxe2x80x99re not for me. Theyxe2x80x99re for my cousin Mose. Hexe2x80x99s just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.n
Nellie: Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that hexe2x80x99s a good man and that I hope he feels better.n
Dwight: Which one? Mose or the real Mose?n
Nellie: The real Mose.n
Andy: [on phone] Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. [pause] What?n
[HTC singing Cornell Alma Mater]n
Erin: Whatxe2x80x99s wrong?n
Andy: My parents are broke.n</div>]
