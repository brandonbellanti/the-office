Pam: Hey Brian, you got a sec?n
Brian: Yeah, hold on a sec.n
Pam: I feel awful.n
Brian: Itxe2x80x99s fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you. [phone rings]n
Erin: [in background] Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.n
Pam: Well, thanks for being a good friend.n
Brian: Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?n
Pam: Yeah, mostly.n
Erin: Pam, phone call.n
Pam: Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa.n
Brian: Will do.n
Pam: Okay. Thank you.n
Brian: Sure.n
Meredith: Hey, boom guy. n
Brian: Oh, hey Meredith.n
Meredith: When are you gonna boom me?n
Brian: Uh, listen, theyxe2x80x99re cracking down on us talking to the subjects. Itxe2x80x99s a lame rule, but, you know, I wannaxe2x80xa6 I, Ixe2x80x99ll see you later.n
Clark: Hey, so I hear youxe2x80x99re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job? n
Dwight: Thatxe2x80x99s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride. n
Clark: Well, uhxe2x80xa6 see, you raised it.n
Clark: You know what, man? I deserve this job. n
Dwight: Mm-hmm. n
Clark: I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyondxe2x80xa6 and under. n
Dwight: Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam. n
Jim: You couldxe2x80x99ve just called that an alliance too, right?n
Clark: [sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too?n
Rolf: No. Youxe2x80x99re interviewing for it. Ixe2x80x99m getting it. n
Clark: Well, I wouldnxe2x80x99t be so sure about that. I mean, Ixe2x80x99ve been working here 12 weeks. Thatxe2x80x99s a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as wexe2x80x99ve seen. n
Rolf: Ixe2x80x99m Rolf. Rolf Ahl.n
Clark: Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl. n
Rolf: Go to hell. n
Clark: There he is. n
Dwight: Hey. Come on, buddy. Letxe2x80x99s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You donxe2x80x99t compare. When youxe2x80x99re with the R-O-L-F, youxe2x80x99re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]n
Pam: When are you talking to David Wallace?n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99m talking to him this afternoon, but donxe2x80x99t get your hopes up. n
Dwight: And this chairxe2x80x99s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha! n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99m on the phone. Ixe2x80x99m on the phone. n
Dwight: No doy!n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99m just gonna call you back. Thanks. n
[Dwight knocking on desk]n
Rolf: I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I donxe2x80x99t do earbuds. n
Dwight: [laughs] No earbuds! [both laugh] n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99m sure hexe2x80x99s just nervous. n
Dwight: So Ixe2x80x99ve got your resume here, but itxe2x80x99s not telling me everything. n
Rolf: Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know youxe2x80x99re qualified to evaluate me?n
Dwight: Well, Ixe2x80x99m the one offering the job. n
Rolf: What are your credentials?n
Dwight: Ixe2x80x99ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. Ixe2x80x99m an Assistant to the Regional Manager. n
Rolf: I think Ixe2x80x99ve heard everything I need to hear. n
Dwight: Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. Ixe2x80x99m sure hexe2x80x99d give a reference. n
Dwight:  What makes you think youxe2x80x99d be an effective paper salesman?n
Trevor: Ooh, okay. Didnxe2x80x99t see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it. n
Dwight: Well, itxe2x80x99s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman. n
Trevor: Pass. Next one. n
Dwight: All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?n
Trevor: No, no and no.n
Dwight: There were only two options. n
Trevor: Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking? n
Dwight: This is a bus transfer. n
Clark: Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?n
Jim: Sure, yeah, go ahead. n
Clark: Thanks, dude. Youxe2x80x94you sure itxe2x80x99s okay? xe2x80x98Cause youxe2x80x99re kindaxe2x80x94n
Jim: Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? Youxe2x80x99re clean, right? n
Clark: Oh, Dove Men.n
Jim: Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You donxe2x80x99t listen to it at all because wexe2x80x99re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, soxe2x80x94n
Clark: Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this? n
Jim: Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do. n
Clark: Thanks, dude. n
Jim: Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face. n
Clark: Why?n
Jim: I need you to breathe in my face right now. n
Clark: [exhales] n
Jim: What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen? n
Clark: Wintergreen. n
Jim: I knew it, I knew it.n
Clark: Yeah, good nose. n
Dwight: Okay, herexe2x80x99s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You canxe2x80x99t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party. n
Clark: Thatxe2x80x99s just a classic no-win situation. n
Dwight: Thank you.n
Clark: So Ixe2x80x99d Kobayashi Maru it.n
Dwight: Damn it! Perfect answer, again. n
Clark: Yep.n
Dwight: Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond xe2x80xa6n
Clark: You know what, Dwight? n
Dwight: And anothxe2x80x94n
Clark: This interviewxe2x80x99s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maruxe2x80x99d the whole process. n
Dwight: No.n
Clark: Yeah. Star Trek rules. n
Dwight: It does, but still no. n
Clark: Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that? n
Dwight: Oh, you think theyxe2x80x99re my only friends? Ixe2x80x99ve got way more friends than that, and theyxe2x80x99re all better than the losers who work here. n</div>, <div class="quote">n[all murmuring] n
Oscar: Just xe2x80x93 I donxe2x80x99t wanna make assumptions based on peoplexe2x80x99s physical appearances. n
Pam: Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell? n
Darryl: They smell so bad. n
Meredith: If I ever get that bad, youxe2x80x99d tell me, right? n
Kevin: Meredith, I tell you all the time. n
Dwight: What quality would make you a good sales associate?n
Mose: People person. n
Dwight: It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical. n
Mose: Thatxe2x80x99s right. n
Dwight: You know we live together, right? n
Mose: Yes. n
Dwight: And Ixe2x80x99ve never seen you go to work, ever. n
Mose: Okay. n
Clark: So howxe2x80x99d you guys hear about the position?n
Gabor: Myxe2x80x94my mom.n
Nate: Dwight called my house, but he didnxe2x80x99t realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I canxe2x80x99t stay out of her stuff. n
Zeke: Dwightxe2x80x99s my cousin, so I overheard him telling my brother Mose about the job opportunity in the shower. n
Clark: You were in the shower or he was in the shower?n
Zeke: Everyone was in the shower. Itxe2x80x99s a cow shower, so therexe2x80x99s like, a ton of people in there. n
Clark: So you guys all know Dwight already? n
Melvina: I was his babysitter, and then we dated for a while. He was a passionate lover and the sweetest little baby. n
Gabor: I knew you looked familiar. You used to pick up Dwight from school. n
Melvina: You went to X-Men school too? [exhales]n
Angela: I donxe2x80x99t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something. n
Stanley: I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didnxe2x80x99t work then. And now look what hexe2x80x99s doing to us. n
Nellie: Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault. n
Jim: How is it my fault? n
Nellie: Herexe2x80x99s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others. n
Jim: But itxe2x80x99s Dwight whoxe2x80x99s bring in all the weirdos. n
Oscar: Yeah, but Jim, Dwightxe2x80x99s a weirdo. We canxe2x80x99t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos. n
David Wallace: [on phone] Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later. n
Jim: Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some inputxe2x80x94n
Dwight: [presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And donxe2x80x99t lie. I can tell if youxe2x80x99re lying. n
David Wallace: Hey, Dwight. Itxe2x80x99s David. n
Dwight: David.n
David Wallace: Jim says hexe2x80x99d like some say in the hiring process. n
Dwight: Really? Thatxe2x80x99s interesting. xe2x80x98Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me whoxe2x80x99s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately. n
Jim: I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wifexe2x80x94n
David Wallace: Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work. n
Jim: Oh. Umxe2x80xa6n
David Wallace: Yeah. n
Jim: Okay. I canxe2x80x99t say that thatxe2x80x99s not fair. n
Dwight: Sounds fair to me, David. n
David Wallace: And I know we have a call scheduled for later xe2x80x93 n
Jim: Oh, yeah, so wexe2x80x99ll just do that later. n
Dwight: No. Why not do it now?n
David Wallace: Yeah. Whatxe2x80x99s up Jim? n
Jim: Uhxe2x80xa6 [clears throat] Well, itxe2x80x99s about Athlead. Ixe2x80x99m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call? n
Dwight: Ixe2x80x99d love to be in the loop, David. n
David Wallace: Itxe2x80x99s okay. Go ahead, Jim. n
Jim: Therexe2x80x99s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor xe2x80x93 n
David Wallace: Okay. Jim, Ixe2x80x99m gonna have to stop you right there. n
Jim: Yes, okay. Bye. n
Dwight: [whispers] Ixe2x80x99d love to invest. n
Jim: No, thanks. n
Hide: Why you make trees into bushes? You donxe2x80x99t make paper from bushes. n
Pam: Hide, theyxe2x80x99re giving out jobs upstairs. Why donxe2x80x99t you go up and get one? n
Hide: Thank you. n
Pam: Yeah. n</div>, <div class="quote">n[hand dryer whirring]n
Jim: Dwight, you canxe2x80x99t just hire someone xe2x80x98cause theyxe2x80x99re your friend.n
Dwight: Ixe2x80x99m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend. n
Nellie: Theyxe2x80x99re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks. n
Dwight: You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero. n
Wolf: Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch. n
Dwight: Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this. n
Wolf: Do you want this paper? n
Dwight: I sure do. n
Wolf: Itxe2x80x99s not very good.n
Dwight: I will pay you whatever it takes. n
Wolf: I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad. n
Dwight: No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money. n
Wolf: Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. Itxe2x80x99s over.n
Dwight: Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. Youxe2x80x99re still at the 570 number? n
Wolf: I am.n
Hide: I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University. n
Dwight: This isnxe2x80x99t gonna work out. n
Dwight: [groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door] n
Melvina: Do you need to be changed? n
Dwight: I do that myself now. n
Dwight: No, youxe2x80x99ve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.n
Melvina: Well, the jokexe2x80x99s on them. I live right next to the tow yard. All they did was save me some gas. n
Trevor: Hey man, we get how difficult this is. And no matter how you choose, wexe2x80x99re still gonna be your friend. n
Wolf: Yeah, whether itxe2x80x99s me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvinaxe2x80x94n
Dwight: Or none of you [chuckles]n
Wolf: Yeah, youxe2x80x99d bring us all down here, put us through the wringer and then choose none of us. n
Trevor: Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you. n
Dwight: I wish I could hire all of you. n
Dwight: Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. n
Jim: Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If Ixe2x80x99m not looking south, Ixe2x80x99m not livinxe2x80x99.  Thatxe2x80x99s what I always say. n
Dwight: And I was thinking itxe2x80x99s only fair that you help make this decision since theyxe2x80x99ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife. n
Jim: But you know I wouldnxe2x80x99t hire any of these all-stars. n
Dwight: Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, itxe2x80x99s your call. n
Jim: Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor? n
Dwight: I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldnxe2x80x99t picture any of them in the old gold and gray. n
Jim: Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You? n
Dwight: Yes. Thank you. Amazed. n
Jim: And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you. n
Sensei Ira: Ixe2x80x99m sorry?n
Dwight: What? This is such bullcrap!n
Jim: Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say. n
Dwight: Wow. So much crap. Itxe2x80x99s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them? n
Jim: Too much now.n
Dwight: Okay. n
Nate: Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep. n
Dwight: Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpertxe2x80x99s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.n
Jim: That seems inconsiderate. n
Rolf: No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Donxe2x80x99t open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe. n
Dwight: Guys, it wasnxe2x80x99t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasnxe2x80x99t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor. n
Trevor: Well, my dayxe2x80x99s shot.n
Rolf: Yeah, itxe2x80x99s that weird hour where itxe2x80x99s too late to start a slow roast and too early for a Swansonxe2x80x99s. n
Wolf: I got it. Paintball. n
Dwight: Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work? n
Trevor: [yelling] And what are we supposed to do until then?n
Dwight: Okay.n
Wolf: Letxe2x80x99s just go, you guys. n
Rolf: Yeah. No limit on weapons class, right? n
Jim: So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then thatxe2x80x99ll print outxe2x80x94Hey. Meet your new desk mate. n
Clark: Whatxe2x80x99s up good lookinxe2x80x99?n
Pam: Oh, cool. Hey Clark. n
Jim: Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering. n
Pam: Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate. n
Jim: Okay. Ixe2x80x99m really sorry I told the guys Ixe2x80x99d be there for the board meeting. n
Pam: Of course. n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99ll call you when I get there.n
Pam: Okay.n
Jim: All right. n
Pam: Bye.n
Clark: Hey, Pam, Ixe2x80x99m going to the kitchen. You want anything?n
Pam: Ixe2x80x99m good. n
Dwight: Oh, hey, Ixe2x80x99ll take a coffee.n
Clark: Oh, Ixe2x80x99m sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee. n
Dwight: [scoffs]n
Pam: Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy? n
Dwight: Who, me?n
Pam: Us. n
Dwight: Absolutely, I do. [giggles]n
Pam: Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, Ixe2x80x99ll distract him, you take that. n
Dwight: Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, thatxe2x80x99s great.n
Pam: [shushes]n
Pam &amp; Dwight: [laughs]n
Dwight: Aah!n
Clark: No!n
Dwight: Welcome to the club, pig! [laughs]n
Pam: No, Dwight!n
Jim: No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when Ixe2x80x99m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.n</div>]
