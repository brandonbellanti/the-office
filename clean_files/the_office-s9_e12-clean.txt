Pam: [on phone]: Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?n
Kevin: I donxe2x80x99t get it. n
Dwight: Aha! A lightbulb. n
Kevin: A lightbul--n
Dwight: A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. [holding note over lamp] Invisible ink.n
Kevin: Whoa.n
Dwight: xe2x80x9cHigher than numbers go.xe2x80x9d The ceiling above accounting!n
Angela: Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight!n
Dwight: An xe2x80x9cX.xe2x80x9d n
Dwight: Oh.n
Kevin: Whoa.n
Dwight: [shouts while cutting up seat cushion - gasps upon finding playing cards]n
Pete: What? n
Oscar: What?n
All: [murmuring as Dwight holds up toy forklift]n
Nellie: So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?n
Erin: Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.n
Nellie: Wow. n
Erin: Itxe2x80x99s just Pete in sunglasses.n
Nellie: Oh.n
Erin: And then we had him xe2x80x9cLikexe2x80x9d Dunder Mifflin. n
Pete: Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them xe2x80x9cLikexe2x80x9d Derekxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cLikes.xe2x80x9dn
Erin: So far, wexe2x80x99re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big. n
Nellie: You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together. n
Jim: Hey.n
Co-worker: Hey Jim. Peter Rowley at Bridgeport Capital requested a meeting at lunch.n
Jim: Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later. n
Dwight: Pfft, xe2x80x9cAthleadxe2x80x9d? Please. Theyxe2x80x99re too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it xe2x80x9cStumpany,xe2x80x9d for xe2x80x9cStupid Company.xe2x80x9d n
Darryl: Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. Thatxe2x80x99s why Ixe2x80x99m doing it. n
Dwight: Youxe2x80x99re working for xe2x80x9cStumpanyxe2x80x9d too? n
Darryl: Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, Ixe2x80x99m switching over.n
Dwight: What?n
Dwight: [on phone] Hey, Halpert, whatxe2x80x99s the big idea? First you jump ship. Now youxe2x80x99re stealing Darryl too. When will it end? n
Jim: Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity. n
Dwight: You wonxe2x80x99t stop until youxe2x80x99ve poached us all. n
Jim: Yeah. Even you.n
Dwight: No. Ixe2x80x99ll be damned if Ixe2x80x99m gonna let us lose me. n
Pam: Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? n
Kevin: Ooh, I havenxe2x80x99t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato? n
Pam: Oh, no, Kevin, itxe2x80x99s not a joke. Angelaxe2x80x99s husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind. n
Pam: Well, Ixe2x80x99m heading out to Cecexe2x80x99s dance recital. n
Pam: Hey, Cece, Daddyxe2x80x99s gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?n
Cece: Yeah. n
Pam: Letxe2x80x99s call him. n
[line trilling]n
Jim: Hey. I was just about to call you. n
Pam: Hey, Hon, are you close? n
Jim: I am still in Philly, actually. n
Pam: What?n
Jim: Itxe2x80x99s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so Ixe2x80x99m stuck here trying to keep him on board. n
Pam: Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you werenxe2x80x99t gonna make it. n
Jim: Pam, I couldnxe2x80x99t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call. n
Cece: I want Daddy.n
Jim: Youxe2x80x99re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommyxe2x80x99s gonna record it. So wexe2x80x99ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?n
Pam: Of course. n
Jim: Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone? n
Pam: Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something. n
Jim: Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes youxe2x80x99re not the best with the phone. n
Pam: I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, wexe2x80x99re getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, xe2x80x9cBye, Daddy.xe2x80x9d n
Cece: Bye, Daddy.n
Jim: Bye. xc2xa0[pause] Yep. See, youxe2x80x99ve still got to press xe2x80x9cEnd,xe2x80x9d Pam. n
Pete: Oh, check it out. This is our first real xe2x80x9cLike.xe2x80x9d n
Erin: Oh, my gosh!n
Pete: Oh! All right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific. n
Erin: Wow. That guyxe2x80x99s really into paper. n
Pete: Yeah.n
Nellie: Well done, you two. n
Erin: We did it. Youth task force forever.n
Pete: Yes. n
Pete: [doing a series of hand bumps with Erin] Bap, bup, bup, bap. Wait. Did I go first and then you?n
Erin: No, you go -- okay.n
Dwight: Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.n
All: [murmuring]n
Dwight: Youxe2x80x99re welcome.n
Phyllis: Wait. This says xe2x80x9cDunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledgexe2x80x9d? n
Dwight: This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.n
Oscar: xe2x80x9cLoyalty pledgexe2x80x9d? n
Darryl: Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. Ixe2x80x99m getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows. n
Dwight: Bust out your complaint files. I need everything youxe2x80x99ve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? xe2x80x9cInfuriating, irresponsiblexe2x80x9d...n
Clark: They got us set up with Windows 95, xc2xa0so youxe2x80x99re kind of dreaming here. n
Dwight: Okay, Ixe2x80x99m gonna need you to print it out. n
Dwight: [writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because itxe2x80x99s an idea. But what does it mean? n
Kevin: Ooh, itxe2x80x99s when you get a free sandwich after youxe2x80x99ve already eaten ten sandwiches. n
Dwight: Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client. n
Mr. Romanko: I wouldnxe2x80x99t say a rage. n
Darryl: Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. Itxe2x80x99s very unlikely it would happen again. n
Mr. Romanko: Thank you. Thank you. n
Dwight: No, youxe2x80x99re not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? xc2xa0L--n
Darryl: Loyalty.n
Dwight: Loyalty. n
Nellie: Loyalty is exactly right. n
Dwight: Thank you.n
Nellie: Yes. I mean, it is everything. Letxe2x80x99s all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships? n
Stanley: Thatxe2x80x99s none of your damn business. n
Nellie: Darryl is xe2x80x9cdatingxe2x80x9d Dunder Mifflin. n
Darryl: Darryl is dating Val... still. n
Nellie: But hexe2x80x99s flirting with Jimxe2x80x99s company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to. n
Mr. Romanko: Ixe2x80x99m sorry. Do I still need to be here?n
Dwight: Yes. n
Nellie: Ixe2x80x99m having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So letxe2x80x99s-- letxe2x80x99s use an example. Take Erin. Erinxe2x80x99s boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean. n
Dwight: Yeah.n
Nellie: So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example? n
Creed: Letxe2x80x99s try it out. n
Nellie: No, letxe2x80x99s-- letxe2x80x99s-- letxe2x80x99s not say Creed. Letxe2x80x99s say Mr. X. n
Angela: Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy. n
Erin: Oh, Ixe2x80x99m sorry. Didnxe2x80x99t you cheat on Andy? n
Angela: Yes. And he didnxe2x80x99t like it. n
Phyllis: Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X? n
Dance Teacher: Ladies and gentlemen, the Little Ladybug Ballerinas. n
[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star plays]n
Ballerinas: One, two, three.n
[Pamxe2x80x99s cell phone ringing]n
Parent in 
Audience: Really?n
Pam: Oh, Ixe2x80x99m sorry. Sorry. n
Ballerinas: One, two, three.n
Pam: [whispering] Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural? [Loudly] Oh, my God! n
Audience: Shh!n
Pam: [whispering] Um, Ixe2x80x99m sorry. I have to go. My daughterxe2x80x99s a ladybug. I know that doesnxe2x80x99t make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you. n
Parent in audience #2: Youxe2x80x99re very rude. n
Parent in audience #1: Yes, very rude.n
Dwight: Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself? n
Darryl: Dwight, look, Ixe2x80x99m sorry youxe2x80x99re having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that. n
Dwight: It canxe2x80x99t be more fun than selling paper and paper products. n
Darryl: It can. n
Phyllis: Well, Andyxe2x80x99s cute, but hexe2x80x99s too vanilla, whereas Pete - hexe2x80x99s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird. n
Meredith: Yeah right. With slamminxe2x80x99 bods like that, they ainxe2x80x99t playing checkers. n
Oscar: People, itxe2x80x99s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man? n
Erin: Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And thatxe2x80x99s the end of it. Right, Pete? n
Pete: That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from? n
Kevin: Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis. n
All: [groan]n
Erin: Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. Ixe2x80x99m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.n
Investor: Listen, I appreciate you taking the time with me. n
Co-worker: Peter, please. We completely understand your concerns here. Let us just show you the latest projections. Jim?n
Jim: Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but hexe2x80x99s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s-- n
[cell phone vibrates]n
Lonnie: Hey boss, you gotta jump on a delivery. n
Darryl: I donxe2x80x99t do that anymore.n
Lonnie: Thatxe2x80x99s what they told me. n
Darryl: All right, letxe2x80x99s get this over with. n
Dwight: Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun! n
[We are young plays on radio]n
Darryl: How far is this place? [turns off radio]n
Dwight: Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]n
Toby: Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there. n
Nellie: Oh, thank you. I donxe2x80x99t know, I sort of thought--n
Toby: [hugging Nellie] So proud of you, Hon. n
Nellie: Oh, I donxe2x80x99t know. Okay. n
Toby: Ixe2x80x99m just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin? n
Nellie: Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one. n
Toby: Petexe2x80x99s a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat. n
Nellie: I didnxe2x80x99t really think about it like that. n
Toby: Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have. n
Nellie: xe2x80x9cWhat we havexe2x80x9d?n
Dwight: Yes. Fast food. Ixe2x80x99ll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day. n
Darryl: They have fast food in Philly. n
Dwight: Not like this. n
Darryl: Exactly like this.n
Fast Food Worker: And your milkshake.n
Dwight: Thank you.n
Darryl: Itxe2x80x99s 30 degrees out. You drinkinxe2x80x99 a mildshake?n
Dwight: Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now thatxe2x80x99s what working at a paper companyxe2x80x99s all about! n
[Darryl take keys out of ignition]n
Dwight: Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.n
Darryl: You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.n
Pam: Anyone want to see the video from Cecexe2x80x99s recital? n
Angela: Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper].n
Oscar: Ixe2x80x99ll watch it. Letxe2x80x99s get this over with. n
Pam: All right, you donxe2x80x99t have to. n
Kevin: Letxe2x80x99s get this over with, Pam. n
Pam: Okay. n
[sound of applause on phone]n
Oscar: Oh.n
Pam: Wait. What? n
Pam: [recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.n
Pam: Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off. n
Oscar: User error. Ixe2x80x99ve heard of that happening to other people.n
Angela: Oscar, donxe2x80x99t rub it in. Ixe2x80x99m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child. n
Pete: Hey.n
Dwight: [cleaning up milkshake in restaurant] It barely even feels like a prank anymore. n
Darryl: You missed a spot. n
Drive Thru Customer: Fire in the hole! [throwing milkshake] Go! Go! Go! Go! [tires screech]n
Nellie: I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force. n
Erin: Oh, no, I really donxe2x80x99t think thatxe2x80x99s a good idea. n
Nellie: Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it. n
Pete: Well, okay, then. n
Erin: I guess we donxe2x80x99t have a choice. n
Nellie: Nope. n
Pete: yeah.n
Erin: Yeah.n
Dwight: [sighs]n
Darryl: [clears throat]n
Dwight: What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee? n
Meredith: Good night.n
Pam: Nightn
Creed: Nightn
Pam: Night, Creed.n
[cell phone rings]n
Pam: Hey.n
Jim: Hey.n
Pam: So, howxe2x80x99s it going?n
Jim: We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. Itxe2x80x99s like everything I did, he just wouldnxe2x80x99t go for it. n
Pam: Ixe2x80x99m so sorry. n
Jim: I have no idea where wexe2x80x99re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks. n
Pam: [sighs] Oh, Ixe2x80x99m sorry. I feel like youxe2x80x99ve already been working insanely hard. n
Jim: Can you figure out how to upload Cecexe2x80x99s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up. n
Pam: Um, actually, funny story -- I didnxe2x80x99t get it. I shouldnxe2x80x99t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all. n
Jim: Youxe2x80x99re not serious, are you? You didnxe2x80x99t get any of the recital? n
Pam: No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part. n
Jim: Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how. n
Pam: Yeah, okay, Ixe2x80x99m sorry. Ixe2x80x99m sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it. n
Jim: Oh, great. So wexe2x80x99ll see somebody elsexe2x80x99s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, itxe2x80x99s really not that hard to film a video. n
Pam: Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit? n
Jim: Look, Pam, I donxe2x80x99t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? Itxe2x80x99s gone. That momentxe2x80x99s just gone. I missed it. n
Pam: I donxe2x80x99t know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there. n
Jim: Youxe2x80x99re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? Ixe2x80x99m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. Youxe2x80x99ve agreed to this. n
Pam: You know what? I-- I-- I donxe2x80x99t think you want to start a conversation with me about whatxe2x80x99s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever -- n
Jim: Pam, Ixe2x80x99m not explaining this to you-- Pam, Ixe2x80x99m not going over this again. n
Co-worker: Jim. We need you.n
Jim: I donxe2x80x99t know how else to tell you, okay? Ixe2x80x99m doing everything I can every week to bring home something...n
Pam: I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want. n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99m doing this just for me? Is that what Ixe2x80x99m doing? Ixe2x80x99m doing it just for me. If thatxe2x80x99s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?n
Pam: Yep. n
Jim: Wexe2x80x99ll talk tomorrow? n
Pam: Yep. Ixe2x80x99ll talk to you tomorrow. n
Jim: Okay. Ixe2x80x99ll talk to you tomorrow.n
Pam: Bye. [quietly crying, sniffling]n
Brian: Hey, you okay?n
Pam: What am I doing wrong, Brian? n
Brian: Nothing. Youxe2x80x99re doing the best you can. n
Cameraman: Brian.n
Brian: Give her a minute. Give her a minute. n
Pam: [crying]n
Brian: Hey, itxe2x80x99s just a tough situation, all right? n
Pam: Itxe2x80x99s getting tougher. I just didnxe2x80x99t know that it was gonna be this hard. n
Brian: Yeah. Letxe2x80x99s turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough.n
Guy: [on video] Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go!n
Darryl: [watching you tube video, laughing]n
Guy: [on video] I nailed that guy, dude. Oh yeah. n
Darryl: And replay.n
Guy: [on video] Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go! I nailed that guy, dude. Oh, yeah.n
Darryl: [sighs] Ixe2x80x99m gonna miss the paper business.n</div>]
