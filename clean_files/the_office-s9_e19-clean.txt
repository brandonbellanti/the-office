Stanley: [humming] What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.n
Erin: Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!n
Stanley:xc2xa0[growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now theyxe2x80x99re making me climb Stair Mountain!n
Stanley: This is an abomination.n
Andy: Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in.n
Oscar: What?n
Andy: I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. Therexe2x80x99s a review of the documentary!n
Phyllis: [gasps] What does it say?n
Andy: I donxe2x80x99t know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, xe2x80x9cRed Alert.xe2x80x9dn
Dwight: Well, the alert was already set to xe2x80x9cRedxe2x80x9d because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to xe2x80x9cDouble Redxe2x80x9d?n
Oscar: xe2x80x9cThe Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scrantonxe2x80x99s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!xe2x80x9dn
Everyone: Whoo! [applause]n
Nellie: xe2x80x9cAndy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy.xe2x80x9dn
Phyllis: Ouch. Sorry, Andy, thatxe2x80x99s-.n
Andy: Itxe2x80x99s okay. [chuckles] The hell does he know?n
Nellie: xe2x80x9cA possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent.xe2x80x9dn
Andy: I want you to print that out for me.n
Erin: xe2x80x9cThough it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.xe2x80x9dn
Nellie: Oh! Which public figure?n
Erin: I bet itxe2x80x99s Katie Couric. Ixe2x80x99ve been saying this for years.n
Phyllis: No, I think they mean more like a politician.n
Stanley: [walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why canxe2x80x99t you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?n
Dwight: Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We couldxe2x80x99ve met in the lobby. Itxe2x80x99s time to go out on a sale! Here we go.n
Stanley: Son, youxe2x80x99ve lost your mind. Ixe2x80x99m not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.n
Dwight: The buyer is your sisterxe2x80x99s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and thatxe2x80x99s an order.n
Stanley: You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.n
Pam: Well, we wonxe2x80x99t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.n
Nellie: Oh, your momxe2x80x99s watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? [chuckles] Oh, um, Embassy Suites. xe2x80x9cDo Not Disturbxe2x80x9d sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.n
Pam:xc2xa0 [laughs] I wish.n
Nellie: [chuckles] What, then?n
Nellie: Marriage counseling?n
Pam: Hmm.n
Nellie: Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?n
Pam: You know, Jimxe2x80x99s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.n
Nellie: Mmm.n
Jim: Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.n
Toby: Oh, sure.n
Jim: Itxe2x80x99s a little, uh, personal.n
Toby: Letxe2x80x99s do it. Letxe2x80x99s get personal.n
Jim: I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.n
Toby: Whoa.n
Jim: Sorry. Ixe2x80x94no, no, no, what I meantxe2x80x94what I meant actually wasxe2x80x94n
Toby: Oh, yeah, no, itxe2x80x99s okay. I can handle it. Um, soxe2x80xa6n
Jim: You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.n
Toby: [chuckles, snorts]n
Jim: Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couplexe2x80x99s counseling.n
Toby: Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam arenxe2x80x99t in couplexe2x80x99s counseling, are you? Oh, God.n
Jim: No, no, no, no, no. Uh, wexe2x80x99re just starting couplexe2x80x99s counseling. Uh, which doesnxe2x80x99t sound any better.n
Toby: Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So sxe2x80x94hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here.n
Clark: My mistake.n
Toby: Yes, it is your mistake. Hexe2x80x99s lingering. So annoying. Ixe2x80x99m gonna kill him. How can I help? Ixe2x80x99m here.n
Angela: Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stanxc2xa0closes limo door]xc2xa0Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.n
Robert: Donxe2x80x99t worry. Ixe2x80x99ve scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the camera together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on.n
Dwight: Andyxe2x80x94[knocks] I need to talk to you.n
Andy: Yeah, come on in. Ixe2x80x99m just on hold with another talent agency. Itxe2x80x99s insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, therexe2x80x99s more. 251. 252. I canxe2x80x99t even keep up!n
Dwight: Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.n
Andy: [grunts intensely] I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. Thatxe2x80x99s final.n
Dwight: So what Ixe2x80x99m hearing you say is, xe2x80x9cMake Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possiblexe2x80x9d?n
Andy: Yes! Ixe2x80x99m sorry Ixe2x80x99m being curt, itxe2x80x99s just Ixe2x80x99m about to land a top talent agent.n
Dwight: Mm-hmm. Good luck.n
Clark: Hey, Dwight.n
Dwight: Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.n
Stanley: Pass.n
Clark: Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?n
Dwight: Donxe2x80x99t worry, itxe2x80x99s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. Itxe2x80x99s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.n
Stanley: Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you haxe2x80x94n
Dwight: [fires tranquilizer gun at Stanley]n
Clark: Holy [bleep].n
Stanley: No, you didnxe2x80x99t. Sick of you and yourxe2x80x94oohxe2x80x94n
Dwight: [fires tranquilizer gun twice]n
Stanley: [falls to the floor with a loud thud]n
Meredith: Man, hexe2x80x99s really in twinkle town now.n
Clark: Is he gonna be okay? I mean, werenxe2x80x99t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?n
Dwight: Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanleyxe2x80x99s got way more body fat than they do.n
Clark: You gave him three shots.n
Dwight: Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Letxe2x80x99s go!n
Clark: All right.n
Dwight: Hexe2x80x99s like a manatee. Ready? Letxe2x80x99s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! [Stanleyxe2x80x99s head hits the door frame] Oh, God.xc2xa0 No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.n
Clark: We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.n
Dwight: [grunts] Okay, wexe2x80x99re good. Wexe2x80x99re good. Letxe2x80x99s go. Push!n
Clark: Any good weekend plans?n
Dwight: I might see a movie.n
Clark: Nice.n
Dwight: What about you?n
Clark: Uh, I donxe2x80x99t know yet.n
Dwight: [grunts] Letxe2x80x99s take himxe2x80x94n
Clark: I was thinking aboutxe2x80xa6n
Dwight: Letxe2x80x99s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?n
Clark: And then what?n
Dwight: Okay, listen. Ixe2x80x99m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but Ixe2x80x99ve never actually done this before.n
Clark: Well, if I may, youxe2x80x99re a natural.n
Dwight: Thank you. I mean, Ixe2x80x99ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uhxe2x80xa6n
Clark: Thatxe2x80x99s a little weird.n
Dwight: [wraps tape around Stanleyxe2x80x99s body]n
Clark: [connect helmet straps around Stanleyxe2x80x99s head] Thatxe2x80x99s about as good as thatxe2x80x99s gonna be.n
Dwight: Okay, now herexe2x80x99s the plan. Ixe2x80x99m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.n
Clark: Catch?n
Dwight: Yeah.n
Clark: I canxe2x80x99t catch him. Hexe2x80x99s like, 250 pounds.n
Dwight: You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? Hexe2x80x99s gonna be moving slowly. Itxe2x80x99s onlyxe2x80x94n
Clark: Blunt?n
Dwight: Itxe2x80x99s 15 feet down, itxe2x80x99s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, itxe2x80x99s like your catching a medicinexe2x80x94n
Clark: Dude, this size of my haunchesxe2x80x94 [Stanleyxe2x80x99s body slips down the stairs and his head thumps into a wall]n
Dwight: Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.n
Clark: We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.n
Jim: So how does it work? Itxe2x80x99s like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, orxe2x80xa6n
Toby: Youxe2x80x99re really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.n
Jim: Mm-hmm.n
Jim: If she can just hang on for a little while longer, Ixe2x80x94this will be so huge for our family.n
Toby: Well, whatxe2x80x99s a little while?n
Jim: What do you mean?n
Toby: I mean, whatxe2x80x99s the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesnxe2x80x99t know when itxe2x80x99s gonna end.n
Erin: Oh, guys, itxe2x80x99s starting! Hurry!n
Kevin: Ooh, therexe2x80x99s Angela! I work with her!n
Andy: Huh, yeah. [chuckles] I mean, Ixe2x80x99m happy Angelaxe2x80x99s the first one getting famous, but itxe2x80x99s a little weird, no? I mean, she canxe2x80x99t sing or act, so itxe2x80x99s actually kind of insane, if you think about it.n
Phyllis: Her hair looks beautiful.n
Andy: Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakinxe2x80x99 movie star! [kicks trash can]n
Erin: Andy!n
Robert: [on the computer screen] I would just to start by saying that there have been some rumors about my personal life that I would like to settle once and for all. As my long-suffering wife can attestxe2x80xa6 I am gay.n
Crowd: [surprised chatter]n
Reporter #1: Senator, were always gay, or did your wife turn you gay?n
Robert: [on the computer screen] Ixe2x80x99ll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy homosexual.n
Pete: Poor Angela.n
Phyllis: Yeah. Poor Angela.n
Robert: I once believed that a gay person could be somewhat straight. It wasnxe2x80x99t until my marriage to Angela that I realized howxe2x80xa6charmless I find the female body.n
Meredith: Oof. Always hurts to hear that one.n
Robert: Therexe2x80x99s someone else I need to thank. His name is Oscar Martinez.n
Andy: Come on!n
Robert: Oscar is the one who opened my eyes to who I really am. For the first timexe2x80x94n
Erin: Oscar is with the Senator too?n
Kevin: Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didnxe2x80x99t know, you didnxe2x80x99t know, and you didnxe2x80x99t freaking know. But I knew! [claps]n
Oscar: He knew!n
Kevin: Yes, we did it!n
Oscar: You did it, Kevin.n
Kevin: Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.n
Robert: --with this new self-awareness, I was finally able to find love at long last. With my amazingxe2x80xa6 Chief of Staff Wesley Silver.n
Oscar: What?!n
Creed: Wesley Silverxe2x80x99s gay?n
Crowd: [surprised chatter]n
Angela: [gasps]n
Kevin: Ohh.n
Creed: They make a nice couple.n
Dwight: Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. Wexe2x80x99re running late. Letxe2x80x99s get him inside.n
Clark: We canxe2x80x99t just leave him bubble wrapped like this.n
Dwight: Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing thatxe2x80x99s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.n
Clark: Thatxe2x80x99s actually really smart.n
Dwight: Thank you.n
Clark: God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.n
Andy: Actor?n
Man: Oh, no. [chuckles] Well, I have an act. Dog, cat, mouse.n
Andy: Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?n
Andy: Does anything go on top of the mouse?n
Man: Yeah. Little hat.n
Andy: Aw, thatxe2x80x99s cute.n
Man: Yeah.n
Andy: Whatxe2x80x99s the mousexe2x80x99s name?n
Clark: Hey, wait, wait, howxe2x80x94how are we doing this?n
Dwight: Well, Ixe2x80x99ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.n
Clark: Just say xe2x80x9carmsxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9clegs,xe2x80x9d okay? That justxe2x80x94thatxe2x80x99s the vernacular that Ixe2x80x99m comfortable with.n
Dwight: Fine, letxe2x80x99s go. [grunts]n
Clark: [sighs]n
Dwight: Hoist his shank on three.n
Clark: Whaxe2x80x94Whatxe2x80x99s a shank?n
Dwight: Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, hexe2x80x99s slouching. Okay, can youxe2x80x94sl-slouch him into the seat. [sighs] Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. [grunts]n
Clark: All right.n
Dwight: Got it?n
Clark: Yeahxe2x80x94yup yup.n
Dwight: [grunts and closes car door] Get in the back.n
Clark: What?n
Dwight: Get in the back.n
Clark: Aw, come on.n
Dwight: Get in.n
Dwight: Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what wexe2x80x99re about to do?n
Stanley: Helllloooo!n
Clark: Okay. We, heyxe2x80x94hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?n
Stanley: Pigeons.n
Dwight: Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like wexe2x80x99ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.n
Clark: Isnxe2x80x99t the client, like, best friends with his sister?n
Nellie: That was exhausting.n
Toby: Blah blah blah blah. Jim.n
Nellie: Well, they deserve each other, then.n
Toby: They do. That they do.n
Nellie: That is for sure.n
Dwight: And forxe2x80x94oh, whoopsie daisy. [chuckles]n
Mrs. Davis: Stanley, what is going on here?n
Dwight: Hexe2x80x99s fine. He gets carsick really easily.n
Clark: Driving.n
Dwight: Itxe2x80x99s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now wexe2x80x99re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?n
Stanley: Ooh-hoo, look at that babyxe2x80xa6n
Dwight: Stanley.n
Stanley: Ohhhxe2x80xa6n
Mrs. Davis: Thatxe2x80x99s Benji in the middle.n
Stanley: Thatxe2x80x99s Benji. Oh, hexe2x80x99s precious. Thatxe2x80x99s a healthy-looking baby.n
Mrs. Davis: Very special little boy.n
Dwight: Look at him. Ixe2x80x99ve never seen such a beautiful child.n
Mrs. Davis: Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, hexe2x80x99ll go, xe2x80x9ceee.xe2x80x9dn
Dwight: Like this? Watch.n
Stanley: Eee.n
Everyone: [laughs]n
Mrs. Davis: Like that.n
Dwight: Yeah, maybe Ixe2x80x99ll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, itxe2x80x99s the most pleasant Ixe2x80x99ve ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.n
Carla: So, what can you do?n
Andy: [Australian accent] Well, what canxe2x80x99t I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadnxe2x80x99t noticed, Ixe2x80x99ve got a pretty good British accent.n
Carla: Can you drive a car?n
Andy: At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here.n
Carla: Why do you have, uh, a high school musical here on your resume? What are you, like, 40? 45?n
Andy: My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaalxe2x80x99s going out on.n
Carla: Gyllenhaal, got it. Can you juggle and crap?n
Andy:: Yes. And yes. [chuckles]n
Carla: Would you dress up as, say, a birthday clown and go to a kidxe2x80x99s party, let xe2x80x98em throw pies at ya?n
Andy: Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. [sniffs] Ixe2x80x99m all for it.n
Carla: Well, Mr. Bernard, Ixe2x80x99m gonna be honest with you.n
Andy: Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.n
Carla: Uh, no. Wexe2x80x99rexe2x80x94wexe2x80x99re gonna take you on as a client.n
Andy: You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me.n
Andy: Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots.n
Todd: Uh, it doesnxe2x80x99t include headshots.n
Andy: It doesnxe2x80x99t include headshots.n
Todd: No.n
Stanley: So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?n
Dwight: You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didnxe2x80x99t even know it. Ixe2x80x99ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. [chuckles] Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.n
Stanley: Oh, no, Ixe2x80x99m not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.n
Dwight: Wellxe2x80x94no, noxe2x80x94nxe2x80x94n
Stanley: [stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground]n
Dwight: [stomps on the ground] We need a winch and a hoist.n</div>]
