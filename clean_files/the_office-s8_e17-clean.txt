Dwight: Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.n
Ryan: Are you holding this chair?n
Dwight: Yes.n
Ryan: xe2x80x98cause I feel like Ixe2x80x99m gonna fall off.n
Dwight: Yes. Yes.n
Ryan: Ixe2x80x99m not wearing the right shoes for this.n
Dwight: We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.n
Nellie: Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think Ixe2x80x99m this patrician goddess. But herexe2x80x99s the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than xe2x80xa6 whatxe2x80x99s lower than dirt?n
Dwight: Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.n
Nellie: Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didnxe2x80x99t even get a callback.n
Jim: Which Spice Girl?n
Nellie: The black one. I never stood a chance.n
Jim: Okay.n
Nellie: Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.n
Dwight: Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.n
Todd Packer: Yepn
Dwight: Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing xe2x80x93 bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. Youxe2x80x99re gonna love xe2x80x98em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a worldxe2x80x99s fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?n
Ryan: When people see this presentation, theyxe2x80x99re gonna [bleep] in their pants.n
Dwight: Okay.n
Jim: Come on, man.n
Cathy: Seriously disgusting.n
Dwight: Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.n
Cathy: Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea.n
Todd Packer: Uhxe2x80xa6n
Nellie: Uhxe2x80xa6 that is excellent.n
Todd Packer: I donxe2x80x99t see what that gets us, but Ixe2x80x99m a team player.n
Nellie: I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.n
Andy: Morning, everyone.n
Kevin: Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?n
Andy: Donxe2x80x99t care. Tell me later.n
Kevin: Listen, itxe2x80x99s important. Youxe2x80x99ve gotta hear this.n
Andy: What do you got?n
Kelly: Oh, my god!n
Phyllis: Do you have a black eye?n
Andy: Yes, I do. Phyllis.n
Kevin: I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?n
Andy: What?n
Kevin: Itxe2x80x99s not a kid on a bike. Itxe2x80x99s a man in a car.n
Darryl: Andy, who punched you?n
Meredith: Hey, I was on the can. Whatxe2x80x99s this about a black guy in the office?n
Angela: Black eye, Meredith.n
Kelly: Will someone please explain whatxe2x80x99s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, itxe2x80x99s like my life is buffering.n
Andy: Herexe2x80x99s what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pamxe2x80xa6n
Pam: Thatxe2x80x99s true.n
Andy: They had, uhxe2x80xa6 weapons.n
Pam: Weapons.n
Andy: I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.n
Pam: But these were not the kind of people who use their words.n
Andy: Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.n
Pam: Thank goodness he was there.n
Oscar: Good job Andy.n
Kevin: Yeah [all murmuring]n
Dwight: Open the gates! Therexe2x80x99s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. Therexe2x80x99s plenty for everyone!n
Man: Quit it.n
Dwight: Therexe2x80x99s plenty. Donxe2x80x99t stampede. No need to stampede, sir.n
Erin: I was ahead of you!n
Dwight: Okay, okay. Hey, hey. Itxe2x80x99s gonna be fine. Itxe2x80x99s gonna be fine. Therexe2x80x99s plenty of Pyramids.n
Cathy: So youxe2x80x99re a blogger right?n
Blogger: Yeah. Blogger.n
Oscar: How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!n
Andy: No.n
Angela: Yes.n
Andy: No, no, no, no, no, we donxe2x80x99t need to call the police. Theyxe2x80x99ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyonexe2x80x99s business, right, Pam?n
Pam: Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.n
Andy: And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.n
Angela: Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?n
Andy: Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.n
Pam: 1-8-5-0-5.n
Darryl: Guys, guys. Thatxe2x80x99s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.n
Phyllis: Look, I donxe2x80x99t feel safe. I think we should call the police.n
Angela: Yes.n
Andy: Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is whyxe2x80xa6 Toby is giving us self defense training.n
Toby: Me?n
Andy: Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?n
Toby: Yeah, um... I canxe2x80x99t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, Ixe2x80x99ll go put on my cup.n
Nellie: Yes!n
Blogger: Okay.n
Nellie: I wasnxe2x80x99t really sure which one of you is Chuck.n
Jim: [on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?n
Blogger: Look at that guy. Hexe2x80x99s got his Sabre phone on, and hexe2x80x99s not even using it.n
Blogger 2: This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog.n
Jim: Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.n
Nellie: Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.n
Dwight: Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99m very sorry.n
Nellie: We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? xe2x80x9cHello. Hi sweetie. Itxe2x80x99s Jim. Ixe2x80x99m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.xe2x80x9dn
Jim: Ixe2x80x99m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?n
Dwight: Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!n
Toby: Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Letxe2x80x99s try it.n
Creed: [smacks Meredithxe2x80x99s head] [screams] [runs out]n
Meredith: Ow.n
Toby: That may have been my fault.n
Meredith: What the hell, Toby?n
Toby: Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, youxe2x80x99re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. xe2x80x9cItxe2x80x99s all about the groin.xe2x80x9d n
Andy: What if youxe2x80x99re being attacked by a xe2x80xa6 smallish man who happens to not have a groin?n
Toby: I donxe2x80x99t think thatxe2x80x99s very common.n
Andy: What if youxe2x80x99re being attacked by a 4xe2x80x9911xe2x80x9d man who is penisless?n
Oscar: Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?n
Andy: Why donxe2x80x99t we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.n
Toby: Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.n
Andy: So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?n
Toby: Itxe2x80x99s interesting that youxe2x80x99re drawn to the point of view of the attacker. xc2xa0You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu. n
Angela: Can I please leave? I have a rape flute. n
Toby: All right, well, letxe2x80x99s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesnxe2x80x99t everyone stand? Okay, so... youxe2x80x99re being attacked. Youxe2x80x99ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two. n
Everyone: One, two.n
Dwight: Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine. n
Lady Blogger: Patty Grossman. Ixe2x80x99m a woman. n
Dwight: But you still work for Wired, right?n
Patty: Yes.n
Ryan: Sabre. Itxe2x80x99s time to come home.n
Jim: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.n
Ryan: Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?n
Dwight: Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.n
Ryan: You know what?n
Dwight: You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.n
Jim: Dwight. n
Dwight: Ixe2x80x99m trying to make him feel important.n
Ryan: God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say. n
Dwight: Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, youxe2x80x99re so smart. Youxe2x80x99re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.n
Ryan: Youxe2x80x99re so ignorant. You barely know what youxe2x80x99re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books. n
Dwight: Whatxe2x80x99s a book? [giggles]n
Ryan: On my God. Youxe2x80x99re so embarrassing. xc2xa0My mom would say the best stuff, though. n
Jim: [ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan. n
Ryan: And you know that Ixe2x80x99m capable of this. n
Jim: Youxe2x80x99re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.n
Ryan: What did you think of the presentation?n
Jim: I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --n
Ryan: Oh! xe2x80x9cFixxe2x80x9d means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!n
Dwight: Jim, get him a water.n
Ryan: No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red! n
Toby: Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that youxe2x80x99re alive.n
Lady: Forgive me for interrupting. I believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here, some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice?n
Andy: [deep voice] I think you guys might have the wrong Office. n
Girl: Thatxe2x80x99s him... the guy I hit.n
Darryl: What?n
Oscar: Youxe2x80x99ve gotta be kidding me.n
Kevin: Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?n
Oscar: No, Kevin -- [sighs]n
Lady: What about the lady you hit with the pine cone?n
Girl: There. That chubby one.n
Pam: I just had a baby.n
Girl: Yesterday?n
Pam: Wow.n
Lady: Apologize.n
Girl: Sorry I kicked your ass in front of your xe2x80x9cthinxe2x80x9d girlfriend.n
Pam: How xe2x80x98bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?n
Lady: You know what? Tiffyxe2x80x99s going to college. n
Andy: [deep voice] Listen, I donxe2x80x99t know what you guys are talking about, but I guess Ixe2x80x99ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.n
Lady: God bless. Friend of mine uses your paper. You do good work. Bye bye.n
Kevin: Bye. n
Kelly: So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- xe2x80x9cHow to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.xe2x80x9dn
Toby: Therexe2x80x99s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me. n
Kelly: No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.n
Darryl: Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.n
Dwight: Have you seen Erin?n
Stanley: Ixe2x80x99m on break.n
Dwight: Oh God... xc2xa0Hey no! Where do you think youxe2x80x99re going? Youxe2x80x99ve gotta stay for the big presentation wexe2x80x99ve got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. Hexe2x80x99s like an even more handsome Bill Gates. n
Blogger: Whenxe2x80x99s the presentation?n
Ryan: [on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, itxe2x80x99s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so itxe2x80x99s different because itxe2x80x99s your wife? xc2xa0Well, that doesnxe2x80x99t make any sense to me. n
Nellie: How you doing?n
Ryan: Donxe2x80x99t talk to me right now. Ixe2x80x99m sorry. I- I know youxe2x80x99re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I donxe2x80x99t understand is... [voice fades]n
Erin: Sorry about kicking you out. Itxe2x80x99s just, we donxe2x80x99t want our brand associated with death.n
Old Lady: Itxe2x80x99s okay. Ixe2x80x99ll go to the Costco and search for handsome men.n
Erin: Youxe2x80x99re not married yet?n
Old Lady: [laughs] Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away. n
Erin: My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and wexe2x80x99re not really friends. n
Old Lady: Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him!n
Erin: Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.n
Dwight: How long has he been in the bathroom?n
Jim: About ten minutes.n
Dwight: Jeez! Whatxe2x80x99s he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates]n
Jim: Oops, thatxe2x80x99s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?n
Dwight: Are there any bloggers around?n
Jim: Itxe2x80x99s Ryan. xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m sorry. I lied. Ixe2x80x99m not in the bathroom. I canxe2x80x99t do it. I need to see my mom. Ixe2x80x99m going home.xe2x80x9dn
Nellie: What is the delay here? Wherexe2x80x99s Ryan? Why is he not here? n
Dwight: I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!n
Jim: Uh...n
Nellie: What?n
Dwight: Thatxe2x80x99s right. Will you just give us a second?n
Nellie: You are gonna bloody ruin it. Youxe2x80x99re gonna bloody ruin it because youxe2x80x99re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...n
Jim: okay.n
Nellie: Thatxe2x80x99s....n
Dwight: Jim --n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99m not doing the Presentation.n
Dwight: Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. Ixe2x80x99m telling you... if you donxe2x80x99t do this, [whispers] I donxe2x80x99t stand a chance. Please, Jim. n
Jim: Okay, Ixe2x80x99ll do it. n
Dwight: Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryanxe2x80x99s costume and check out his notes.n
Jim: A costume?n
Dwight: Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99ve been in here for 20 seconds.n
Dwight: Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner? n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99m not wearing eyeliner.n
Dwight: You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.n</div>, <div class="quote">n[Coldplayxe2x80x99s Clocks]n
Jim: Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, thatxe2x80x99s -- n
Dwight: Itxe2x80x99s true.n
Jim: This... is the future, because... This is the past. Ixe2x80x99ve been through a lot of issues in my life. Ixe2x80x99ve seen drug addiction -- unemployment. Ixe2x80x99ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]n
Dwight: Yep.n
Jim: When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. xc2xa0I just wanted... to go home. xc2xa0This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. xc2xa0You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space. n
Crowd: ahhhhhhn
Dwight: Psst.n
Jim: Oh. n
Ryan: [image on Pyramid] Sabre... Itxe2x80x99s time... to come home. n
Crowd: [applause]n
Jim: All right. xc2xa0Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]n
Toby: Okay, this isnxe2x80x99t over. Letxe2x80x99s stay focused, okay? xc2xa0We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous. n
Kevin: Whether itxe2x80x99s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity. n
Toby: Okay. Good point...n
Angela: Good point? What is a tub of electricity?n
Toby: I donxe2x80x99t... I donxe2x80x99t...n
Oscar: With all due respect we know what wexe2x80x99re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.n
Kelly: I was a twelve year old bully.n
Angela: Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby. n
Others: Yeah.n
Kelly: Yeah, thatxe2x80x99s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.n
Angela: Thanks.n
Kelly: Good. Letxe2x80x99s go.n
Toby: I donxe2x80x99t know if this is gonna help...Uh...n
Angela: Letxe2x80x99s go Kelly.n
Toby: We should stay to maybe some more traditional models...n
Kelly: You think youxe2x80x99re so pretty! xc2xa0Well youxe2x80x99re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time! n
Toby: Okay, this is whatxe2x80x99s called pre-violent posturing.n
Kelly: Take that! xc2xa0Not so pre-violent anymore!n
Toby: Okay, Ixe2x80x99m at whatxe2x80x99s called xe2x80x9cthe decision point.xe2x80x9dn
Andy: Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!n
Pam: [laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, Ixe2x80x99m not laughing at you. Ixe2x80x99m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning. n
Dwight: Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. xc2xa0We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.n
Nellie: Dwight. xc2xa0Youxe2x80x99re the vice president. n
Dwight: Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah! n
Nellie: [squealing]n
Dwight: Okay! Come on!n
Nellie: aagh!n
Dwight: Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!n</div>]
