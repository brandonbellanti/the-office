Jim: Hey, so this isnxe2x80x99t matching up with thisxe2x80xa6and Ixe2x80x99m not sure which onexe2x80x99s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?n
Kevin: Yes. Me do.n
Jim: Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?n
Kevin: Me do it now.  Go.  Stop worry.n
Pam: Kevin, do you feel OK?n
Kevin: Me feel good.  Body strong.  Sleep big last night.n
Pam: Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.n
Jim: Yeah, alright Kev why donxe2x80x99t you come with us?n
Oscar: No, guys.n
Angela: No, hexe2x80x99s fine.n
Oscar: Hexe2x80x99s fine.n
Angela: Hexe2x80x99s always been like that.n
Pam: No he hasnxe2x80x99t.n
Angela: I mean, hexe2x80x99s gotten worse over the yearsxe2x80xa6.n
Oscar: Hexe2x80x99s making a statement. Itxe2x80x99s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.n
Andy: Kevin, I appreciate what youxe2x80x99re trying to do.n
Kevin: Thank.n
Andy: Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code.  And what wexe2x80x99re talking about isxe2x80xa6basically the speech equivalentxe2x80xa6 to just wearing underpants.  Sometimes words, you no need usexe2x80xa6but need need for talk talk.n
Kevin: But save time. More success.n
Jim: Does it save time though? xe2x80x98Cause wexe2x80x99ve been here for about an hour.n
Kevin: No me fault.n
Pam: Kevin, at most youxe2x80x99re saving a microscopic amount of time.n
Kevin: Many small time make big time.n
Andy: What are you gonna do with all this time?n
Kevin: See world.n
Pam: Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.n
Jim: K, Kevin, are you saying xe2x80x9cSee the worldxe2x80x9d? or xe2x80x9cSea World?xe2x80x9dn
Kevin: See world.  Oceans. Fish.  Jump. China.n
Jim: No, see? Right there, thatxe2x80x99s the problem with your method. xe2x80x98Cause I still donxe2x80x99t know if youxe2x80x99re saying xe2x80x9cSea Worldxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9csee the world,xe2x80x9d and itxe2x80x99s taking a lot of time to explain it.n
Dwight: This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tabletxe2x80xa6.the Pyramid.  [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]n
Phyllis: Ooh, why is it shaped like that?n
Dwight: So, you can tell your clients: xe2x80x9cUnleash the power of the pyramid.xe2x80x9dn
Pam: Itxe2x80x99s huge.  How much does it weigh?n

Oscar: xe2x80xa6xe2x80x9dC-SPANxe2x80x9d?n
Andy: Yeah.  C-SPAN, cocker spaniel.  Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker causexe2x80xa6xe2x80xa6n
Dwight: Is this really the best use of our collective time?n
Andy: I am still forming a first impression with Robert.  Once it is formed, we can all relax.  Ok, Ixe2x80x99m sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dogxe2x80xa6had to pull rank.n
Dwight: [To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.n
Erin: Um, D-Dog, you have a message.n

Robert: Hello, Andy.  Excellent tie.n
Erin: Would you be requiring a cold beverage while youxe2x80x99re here?n
Robert: I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better.n
Andy: Are you factoring in thexe2x80xa6 whole national xe2x80xa6economyxe2x80xa6. declining and all that?n
Robert: Andy, do you know why I chose you?n
Andy: I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavorxe2x80xa6.vanilla?n
Robert: Vanilla? No no no no.  Youxe2x80x99ll never guess in a million billion years youxe2x80x99ll never guess.n
Andy: You were saying you chose mexe2x80xa6. There was a reason?n

Erin: Sorry.n
Robert: You like her.n
Andy: I do.n
Robert: She likes you.n
Andy: You know, wexe2x80x99ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up.  Now wexe2x80x99re in this weird dancexe2x80xa6.n
Oscar: Let me call you back.n
Meredith: I gotta go.n
Robert: If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?n

Robert: Ahxe2x80xa6n
Kevin: This is where we gon
Robert: [chuckling] Oh, youxe2x80x99d go someplace else.  Thatxe2x80x99s not it, thatxe2x80x99s not the answer.n
Kevin: Itxe2x80x99s a answer.n
Robert: Itxe2x80x99s a wrong answer.n
Kevin: There are no wrong answers.n
Robert: Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at itxe2x80x99s birth.  Those superstores are terrified of us.  Anybody know why?n
Phyllis: Waitxe2x80xa6.theyxe2x80x99re terrified?n
Robert: Let me tell you how I buy something these days.  I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price.  Or I donxe2x80x99t know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me.  The era of personal service is back. You are back.  Youxe2x80x99ll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them xe2x80x9cyou are welcome.xe2x80x9d [Applause] Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people.  Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen.  Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.n

Andy: If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robertxe2x80xa6man.  What a boss.  Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, howxe2x80x99s the sales doubling xe2x80xa6project going?n
Phyllis: Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We canxe2x80x99t just press a magic button.n
Andy: OF course not.  Therexe2x80x99s no magic button.  You have to summon that.n
Stanley: If we could just double our sales, we already would have.  Youxe2x80x99re not making any sense.n
Jim: He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?n
Andy: Dwight, anything?n
Dwight: We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it theyxe2x80x99re out of the house.n
Andy: You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box.  If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.n

Andy: No, thatxe2x80x99s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you aboutxe2x80xa6n
Dwight: Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just donxe2x80x99t see the point. Itxe2x80x99s so Wall Street.n

Dwight: Right?n
Andy: Yeahxe2x80xa6um, how is everything?n
Dwight: Good. Really really good.n
Andy: Must be a tough time to be a family farm.n

Angela: Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?n
Pam: I flipped through it.n
Angela: So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while youxe2x80x99re pregnant?n
Pam: Of course.n
Jim: We know that.n
Pam: Yeah.n

Andy: These are incentives.  Itxe2x80x99s how wexe2x80x99re gonna double growth. Now, youxe2x80x99re probably all asking yourselves: xe2x80x9cWell, how does this work?xe2x80x9dn
Pam: Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.n
Andy: Youxe2x80x99re exactly right and you get a point.n
Pam: Oh. [smiling]n
Ryan: Uh, is that a vibrator?n
Andy: Twenty points.n
Meredith: How does one get a point?n
Andy: Ixe2x80x99ve outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.n
Kelly: Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? Itxe2x80x99s so gross.n
Andy: Therexe2x80x99s lots of stuff.  John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.n
Stanley: How xe2x80x98bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.n
Andy: I canxe2x80x99t.n
Kelly: This point system is really insulting.n

Jim: Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.n
Andy: Bahxe2x80xa6I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.n

Andy: Hundred and twenty points.n

Erin: What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.n
Andy: I don't have any ideas though.n
Erin: Well I have an idea.n
Andy: You do?n
Erin: What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.n
