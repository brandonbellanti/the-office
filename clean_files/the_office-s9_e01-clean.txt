Pete: I donxe2x80x99t want it, really.n
Angela: How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?n
Pete: I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.n
Angela: Have you taken any concrete steps?n
Dwight: Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means itxe2x80x99s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.n
Pam: I will?n
Dwight: You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldnxe2x80x99t you say?n
Pam: Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.n
Dwight: So youxe2x80x99ll do it?n
Pam: No.n
Dwight: Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.n
Pam: Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.n
Dwight: Come on.n
Pam: Exactly the way it is.n
Dwight: No, Pam.n

Oscar: You know what? I will take Comstock.n
Angela: Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!n
Oscar: Ixe2x80x99ll come by after work and pick him up.n
Angela: Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He wonxe2x80x99t get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonightn
Oscar: Cxe2x80x99est la vie.n
Pam: You ready?n
Jim: Yeah. You know what? Ixe2x80x99ll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.n
Meredith: Crap. Sorry, Nellie.n
Nellie: Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we wouldxe2x80x94[hit in the face with trash]n
Nellie: [As trash is thrown at her] Fluke.n</div>]
