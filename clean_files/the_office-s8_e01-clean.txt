Andy: [exiting elevator] After you my good sir.n
Dwight: No, I insist.n
Andy: [drumroll with hands] Ixe2x80xa6 itxe2x80x99s unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choicexe2x80x99s first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, xe2x80x9cI need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.xe2x80x9d Smart, right?n
Kelly: (planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.n
Andy: Uh, this has got to stop.n
Dwight: K, Ixe2x80x99m gonna need some help. Pam?n
Jim: Oh, yeah. Pregnant.n
Pam: Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly]n
Jim: No, I told you I donxe2x80x99t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.n
Angela: Look, itxe2x80x99s a xe2x80x98Little Pregsxe2x80x99 [points to her belly] and xe2x80x98Big Pregsxe2x80x99 [points to Pamxe2x80x99s]n
Pam: Wait, when did we start calling it that-n
Angela: Isnxe2x80x99t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?n
Pam: Well, I am a few months ahead of you.n
Dwight: Hoist him aloft. Cxe2x80x99mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]n
Jim: No one should be planking at all.n
Andy: Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?n
Jim: You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know itxe2x80x99s just gonna make you cry?n
Pam: Because everything makes me cry, so whatxe2x80x99s the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.n
Jim: Hexe2x80x99s got a bank vault. Thatxe2x80x99s a start.n
Erin: Here we go.n
Robert: Hello.n
Erin: Robert California. Letxe2x80x99s have a conversation.n
Robert: Describe your day so far.n
Erin: Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-n
Robert: And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. Itxe2x80x99s a waste of your time. Thatxe2x80x99s how every dayxe2x80x99s begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man.n
Erin: Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And Ixe2x80x99ve been doing this thing-n
Erin: Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. [motions her over, both looking at Robertxe2x80x99s notebook]n
Pam: Jim. [motions him over]n
Andy: The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?n
Robert: What are your thoughts.n
Dwight: What are you looking at?n
Jim: Itxe2x80x99s, itxe2x80x99s nothing.n
Dwight: It canxe2x80x99t be nothing.n
Phyllis: Yeah, it canxe2x80x99t be nothing.n
Jim:xc2xa0 Itxe2x80x99s just a list of our names, split into two columns.n
Stanley: What?n
Jim: Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?n
Erin: No.n
Jim: No. Okay. Um, Ixe2x80x99ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?n
Dwight: [throws hard, Jim doesnxe2x80x99t catch] Nice catch.n
Pam: If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier]n
Kevin: We need a warning signal.n
Jim: We donxe2x80x99t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-n
Kevin: We do.n
Jim: I promise you, we donxe2x80x99t need a warning-n
Kevin: WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!n
Phyllis: Ahhh! [falls out of chair]n
Dwight: Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?n
Phyllis: Yeah. Yeah. Oh.n
Dwight: xe2x80xa6 2, 3! [pulls Phyllis up]n
Phyllis: Thanks guys.n
Dwight: Okay, which side of the list am I on?n
Jim: Left.n
Dwight: Yes!n
Andy: Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.n
Jim: Uh, no, actually. That was in Robertxe2x80x99s notebook.n
Pam: He left it at reception and we photocopied it.n
Andy: Oh, okay. I donxe2x80x99t want any part of this.n
Pam: Maybe itxe2x80x99s a list of people hexe2x80x99s gonna fire.n
Dwight: This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Herexe2x80x99s something. Who would eat who in an xe2x80x98Alivexe2x80x99 situation. No... that canxe2x80x99t be it.n
Andy: I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left sidexe2x80x99s the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.n
Jim: I donxe2x80x99t think itxe2x80x99s-n
Pam: xe2x80x98Scuse me?n
Angela: Did you guys figure it out?n
Andy: We couldnxe2x80x99t crack it.n
Stanley: Go in there and just ask the man what it means.n
Andy: Hexe2x80x99ll know that we looked at his private notebook.n
Phyllis: Cxe2x80x99mon, just say you saw the list by accident.n
Andy: Ixe2x80x99m already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and itxe2x80x99s starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.n
Robert: [Andy continuously knocking on door] Yes, for godxe2x80x99s sake Andy. Yes, come in.n
Andy: Whatxe2x80x99s up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.n
Robert: Great. Thank you.n
Andy: And it was open. And people saw this. And theyxe2x80x99re just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.n
Robert: What is this?n
Andy: Itxe2x80x99s a photocopy from your notebook.n
Robert: You read my notebook? And photocopied it. And distributed it.n
Andy: No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.n
Robert: Ah, please. Herexe2x80x99s what it is. Itxe2x80x99s a doodle.n
Andy: What?n
Robert: Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Donxe2x80x99t you think? Well, I doodle too, but Ixe2x80x99m not an artist. So I draw words and lists.n
Andy: That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?n
Andy: Okay. Robertxe2x80x99s in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?n
Meredith: Maybe wexe2x80x99re sxe2x80x99posed to do it with people in our group.n
Jim: Thatxe2x80x99s not it.n
Meredith: People in the other group.n
Jim: Mmum, still wrong.n
Andy: Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?n
Stanley: Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add xe2x80x98em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!n
Andy: Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.n
Kevin: I know! Itxe2x80x99s alphabetical.n
Everyone: [separately] No.n
Dwight: No, itxe2x80x99s not. Herexe2x80x99s how we find out. Letxe2x80x99s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Letxe2x80x99s just size each other up here and left side of the listxe2x80xa6 ATTACK!n
Jim: Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]n
Andy: Dwight!n
Meredith: Hey!n
Kevin: Warning! Warning! Warning!n
Robert: [enters room, everyone quiets and separates] Ixe2x80x99d like to invite the following people to join me for lunch: Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl, Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar.n
Dwight: Thatxe2x80x99s great. Letxe2x80x99s do this guys.n
Jim: Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.n
Pam: I love you so much. [starting to cry]n
Jim: Hey. Itxe2x80x99s nothing. Alright? Ixe2x80x99ll text you when we get there. Let you know whatxe2x80x99s going on.n
Pam: Okay. [turns to computer]n
Jim: Nope. No dog video.n
Pam: Okay.n
Jim: Okay. See you guys.n
Robert: Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street?n
Jim: Uhhh, the street?n
Robert: Sesame street.n
Jim: Oh, I didnxe2x80x99t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.n
Robert: Elmo, godxe2x80x99s sake, itxe2x80x99s the Elmo era.n
Jim: Right.n
Robert: Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldnxe2x80x99t you agree.n
Jim: Yeah, she does like Elmo.n
Oscar: Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.n
Phyllis: Completely.n
Darryl: Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.n
Kevin: The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.n
Andy: Great group! Pizza party!n
Kelly: How is this a pizza party?n
Andy: Well, why donxe2x80x99t you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.n
Kelly: Yeah, well, thatxe2x80x99s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.n
Andy: Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?n
Stanley: Whatxe2x80x99s that?n
Andy: Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.n
Stanley: Thatxe2x80x99s pizza.n
Dwight: You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?n
Robert: I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you.n
Dwight: Okay!n
Everyone: [separately] Awww.n
Phyllis: Well, what about the other guys.n
Dwight: Losers.n
Robert: No.n
Dwight: Cxe2x80x99mon.n
Robert: I donxe2x80x99t- I donxe2x80x99t wanna say-n
Dwight: Cxe2x80x99mon, cxe2x80x99mon.n
Robert: No, no.n
Dwight: Cxe2x80x99mon.n
Robert: Ha, I guess I think theyxe2x80x99re losers.n
Dwight: Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!n
Andy: Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.n
Pam: [Pamxe2x80x99s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Jim. xe2x80x9cThis is getting very weird. Will explain later.xe2x80x9dn
Pam: [Everyonexe2x80x99s phone vibrates] Oh, text from Kevin.n
Ryan: Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesnxe2x80x99t the fact that Ixe2x80x99m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!n
Pam: I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, xe2x80x9cWhoxe2x80x99s that receptionist? I like her.xe2x80x9d Now Ixe2x80x99m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and youxe2x80x99re like, xe2x80x9cOh, loser.xe2x80x9dn
Andy: Cxe2x80x99mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?n
Pam: Oh. Oh God.n
Kelly: [door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?n
Angela: It was excellent.n
Darryl: Good times.n
Andy: Yeah?n
Jim: Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?n
Kevin: [spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up xe2x80x9cLxe2x80x9d to his forehead]n
Andy: Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please itxe2x80x99s really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, letxe2x80x99s say top-tier and others would be second-tier.n
Robert: I never said that.n
Andy: Thank you. Great.nRobert. I said winners and losers. Is that what youxe2x80x99re talking about?n
Andy: Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what Ixe2x80x99m thinking of. Can you clarify that?n
Robert: Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty. Ixe2x80x99ll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. And then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think youxe2x80x99re a winner. If I didnxe2x80x99t, I donxe2x80x99t. But I just met you all. Life is long, opinions change. Winners prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong.n
Phyllis: Whew, well. I guess thatxe2x80x99s that.n
Andy: No. No, no.n
Erin: Andy, donxe2x80x99t go in there!n
Andy: I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you donxe2x80x99t know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then Ixe2x80x99m not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.n
Robert: Ixe2x80x99m not gonna change my list, Andy, and I donxe2x80x99t use ballpoint pens.n
Andy: Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think hexe2x80x99s a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think hexe2x80x99s hard to love, but did you know that hexe2x80x99s in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?n
Robert: I did not know about the sales figures.n
Andy: Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word xe2x80x9cnoxe2x80x9d not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that Ixe2x80x99m being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.n
Dwight: Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.n
Jim: Shhh.n
Robert: Are we done?n
Andy: Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, wexe2x80x99re gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.n
Robert: You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day?n
Andy: Yes, I do.n
Robert: And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of Native Americans.n
Andy: Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.n
Stanley: We get that every year.n
Andy: Well, you got it this year too.n
Phyllis: Good night, Andy.n
Andy: Night.n
Angela: Bye.n
Oscar: Good night Andy.n
Dwight: Good night.n
Jim: Alright, Ixe2x80x99m gonna go warm up the car.n
Andy: I gotta say, I think it's kinda cool not knowing. It's like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It's kinda sophisticated.n
Kelly: Everybody hates those endings!n
Oscar: I- [Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.]n
Kevin: I was looking for patterns.n
Ryan: It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him.n
Creed: I made a list like this for Congress when I worked in Hollywood in the 50's, they're meaningless.n
Dwight: [grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast.n
Jim: Ryan? A little help?n
Jim: Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.n
Robert: That sounds good.n
Kevin: Chicken piccata, side salad.n
Darryl: Chicken piccata, salad on the side please.n
Oscar: I'll start with a side salad and uh, oh, chicken piccata.n
Toby: Chicken piccata, side salad.n
Angela: Side salad, chicken piccata on the side.n
Phyllis: I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.n
Dwight: Steak. Rare.n
Robert: Jim, you alright? What are you doing?n
Pam: Oh! Text from Jim. xe2x80x9cThis is...xe2x80x9d hmm.n
Dwight: One more. To our boss!n
All: Hey!n
Jim: I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole. [everyone clinks glasses]n
Dwight: You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.n
Robert: I can expense it.n
Darryl &amp; Oscar: Let him expense it, Dwight.n
Dwight: I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?n
Robert: Thank you.n
Waiter: Hi, Mr. Shrute. I've waited on you before. I just wanted to let you know that gratuity is not included in the bill and tips are expected.n
Dwight: Oh, tips are expected?n
Waiter: Yes sir.n
Gabe: My entire childhood, I was the one left out, and I said to myself: Gabe, if you just achieve some success, you'll be part of them. You'll be part of the happy ones. But instead, people just used my success as a new way to shut me out.n
Dwight: Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!n
Jim: Come on, man.n
Dwight: Winners!n</div>]
