Erin: The tea in Nepal is very hot. n
Erin: The tea in Nepal is very hot.n
Dwight: But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.n
Erin: Close.n
Dwight: This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?n
Erin: Colder.n
Dwight: The coffee in Paraguay is colder?n
Erin: No, I meant youxe2x80x99re getting colder. The correct response is, xe2x80x9cthe coffee in Peru is much hotter.xe2x80x9dn
Dwight: Ah, much, ok.n
Erin: But, thatxe2x80x99s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?n
Dwight: [while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!n
Philip: Mama!n
Oscar: Angela, someone wants you.n
Esther: Go get xe2x80x98em, honey.n
Andy: Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary thatxe2x80x99s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick. n
Check-in guy: Ok, thanks. Go ahead and get in the back of the line.n
Jim: Sales form for you to sign.n
Dwight: Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.n
Jim: Aw, thanks, man.n
Dwight: Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but wexe2x80x99ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World Warxe2x80x94n
Jim: No.n
Jim: Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.n
Pam: Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.n
Jim: All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.n
Pam: Is that them again?n
Jim: Yeah.n
Pam: Maybe you should call back?n
Dwight: Welcome.n
Jim: He welcomes you.n
Dwight: Please take an agenda item.n
Jim: Your agenda-taking pleases him.n
Dwight: Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. xe2x80x9cSome say the only failure there is is the failure to try.xe2x80x9d [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.n
Jim: Letxe2x80x99s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if youxe2x80x99re expecting a fax today, please donxe2x80x99t yell out, xe2x80x9cMichael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.xe2x80x9d Ok? Thatxe2x80x99s nonsense.n
Pam: Question.n
Jim: Yes, beautiful girl in the front.n
Pam: We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as theyxe2x80x99re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, xe2x80x9cNice jugsxe2x80x9d?n
Jim: Thatxe2x80x99s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?n
Everyone: [overlapping] Zero. No nonsense. You canxe2x80x99t have nonsense.n
Dwight: [as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?n
Angela: Daycare wonxe2x80x99t take Phillip anymore.n
Oscar: Why?n
Angela: Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they wonxe2x80x99t forgive. So, hi.n
Oscar: Hi, buddy.n
Dwight: Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.n
Dwight: Ixe2x80x99m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.n
Andy: This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang xe2x80x9cI Dreamed a Dreamxe2x80x9d from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.n
Casey: Whoo-hoo! Casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio! [singing] Doctor, doctor, gimme the news, I got a great Casey Dean for you.n
Andy: No!n
Casey: America wants it!n
Andy: No, this is my time! You donxe2x80x99t belt on my time! I belt on my time.n
Casey: [singing] Casey Dean!n
Andy: [vocalizing over her] Casey Dean!n
Casey: Man, those are some nice pipes.n
Andy: Yeah.n
Casey: Whatxe2x80x99s your name?n
Angela: Why didnxe2x80x99t you pack the apple snacks?n
Oscar: Why didnxe2x80x99t you pack the apple snacks?n
Kevin: Guys.n
Angela: Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.n
Kevin: Guys.n
Angela: Why donxe2x80x99t you pack it?n
Kevin: Guys.n
Angela &amp; Oscar: Kevin, what?n
Kevin: Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says xe2x80x9cbold frontxe2x80x9d instead of xe2x80x9ccold frontxe2x80x9d? Itxe2x80x99s insane.n
Angela: Not now, Kevin. Canxe2x80x99t you see wexe2x80x99re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.n
Oscar: Seriously, Kevin. Ixe2x80x99m just gonna have to go to the store.n
Dwight: Not now! Private time!n
Jim: I love Star Wars as much as the next guyxe2x80x94n
Dwight: Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]n
Jim: My god, Ixe2x80x99m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.n
Dwight: Which is, of coursexe2x80xa6n
Jim: Potential future nonsense.n
Dwight: Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.n
Jim: Ixe2x80x99m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. Youxe2x80x99ve got a regional manager.n
Dwight: The power source.n
Jim: Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.n
Dwight: A loyal, but bungling apostle.n
Jim: But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?n
Dwight: Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.n
Jim: Exactly.n
Dwight: Ixe2x80x99d have to get some more wire and string, but itxe2x80x99s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?n
Jim: Yeah, right. I mean, unless theyxe2x80x99re willing to pass some tests.n
Dwight: I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?n
Jim: Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?n
Casey: Whatxe2x80x99re you listening to?n
Andy: Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.n
Casey: Oh, sweet.n
Andy: A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.n
Mark McGrath: Whatxe2x80x99s up, everybody? And welcome to Americaxe2x80x99s Next A Cappella Singing Sensation!n
Casey: Ah! Itxe2x80x99s Mark McGrath! Oh my god! Youxe2x80x99re gorgeous!n
Mark McGrath: Thank you, thank you so much. And thank you for your patience. And we hope to see you guys within the next five to seven hours. Now, just to give you a couple parameters of the show, each of you will sing a song for thirty seconds, after which our judges will decide if they want you in their a cappella group. Now, each group will start with 90 singers, which will compete in a series of singing and physical challenges. Oh, and look out for that pesky mole!n
Andy: Therexe2x80x99s a mole?n
Mark McGrath: Oops. Ixe2x80x99m not supposed toxe2x80x94Ixe2x80x99m not supposed to say that. All right, no mole. Forget I said it, all right?n
Andy: What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.n
Mark McGrath: Good man right there. Ixe2x80x99ll see you guys inside. Good luck, all right?n
Andy: Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me! n
Casey: What? On a roll much?n
Andy: I donxe2x80x99t know where it came from.n
Casey: That was amazing, man!n
Andy: Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.n
Casey: Yeah, you made a personal connection with him.n
Andy: I did, I felt it.n
Pam: What are you so excited about?n
Jim: Nothing.n
Jim: Members of the office, hear ye. n
Dwight: That means ye, Plop!n
Pete: Plop? Still?n
Dwight: We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?n
Pete: Fine.n
Jim: Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.n
Erin: Aw, heck ya!n
Pam: Nice.n
Dwight: Youxe2x80x99ll always have the upper hand, when youxe2x80x99ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.n
Jim: This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but thatxe2x80x99s for fueling only. No savoring.n
Dwight: Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.n
Jim: He envies you.n
Dwight: You donxe2x80x99t need to repeat right now, when Ixe2x80x99m saying it.n
Darryl: What up?n
Glenn: Whatxe2x80x99s going on? How was the delivery?n
Jim: A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?n
Meredith: Uh, two.n
Jim: 985,000,000,000,017.n
Dwight: Not even close, Meredith. Come on!n
Jim: Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?n
Pam: Theme song from Saved by the Bell.n
Jim: Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.n
Dwight: Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each otherxe2x80x99s minds. Youxe2x80x99re trying to give your wife this job.n
Jim: Thatxe2x80x99s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?n
Pete: A horse.n
Jim: Ew, the exact opposite, actually.n
Pete: Whatxe2x80x99s the opposite of a horse?n
Jim: Come on. n
Jim &amp; Dwight: Sea horse.n
Jim: Whoa. How did you know that I was gonnaxe2x80x94n
Jim: Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?n
Clark: Yeah.n
Jim: Do you want a corn dog?n
Clark: I would love a corn dog.n
Jim: Wexe2x80x99ll see. You are an assistant whoxe2x80x99s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.n
Clark: [reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.xe2x80x9dn
Dwight: No, no, no, no! You donxe2x80x99t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. Therexe2x80x99s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries donxe2x80x99t have diplomatic relations.n
Soldier: I just hope that if my buddies who are still in Afghanistan see me win, theyxe2x80x99ll feel like anything is possible.n
Andy: Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.n
Casey: Over at the porta-potties, they were interviewing a homeless, single mother with three kids.n
Andy: What?n
Casey: Yeah.n
Andy: Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?n
Casey: I donxe2x80x99t know. But Ixe2x80x99m getting really worried here.n
Andy: Me too. Hold my place in line.n
Casey: Where are you going?n
Darryl: Thanks, man.n
Hank: Thank you.n
Darryl: Yep. Take care.n
Pam: Darryl, hey.n
Darryl: Hey.n
Pam: Cool, are you coming back to say hi?n
Darryl: No, no, Ixe2x80x99m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didnxe2x80x99t say goodbye to.n
Pam: Aha. Howxe2x80x99s Athlead?n
Darryl: We livinxe2x80x99 like rock stars. Ixe2x80x99m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.n
Pam: Wow. n
Darryl: Jim really doesnxe2x80x99t want to come?n
Pam: He says he doesnxe2x80x99t want to.n
Darryl: Wow. Man. I hope he doesnxe2x80x99t regret it.n
Pam: Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.n
Darryl: Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?n
Pam: Thatxe2x80x99s what he says.n
Jim: An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?n
Dwight: A thousand times more.n
Phyllis: Ixe2x80x99ll try this one. n
Jim: Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.n
Phyllis: [grabbing the coffee] Hot!n
Jim: Yeah. Itxe2x80x99s real. Itxe2x80x99s the only way youxe2x80x99ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! Shexe2x80x99s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!n
Dwight: [over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?n
Jim: Look at that form.n
Dwight: [running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Herexe2x80x99s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah! n
Jim: Uncanny. [everyone applauds]n
Erin: Darryl?! Darryl!n
Kevin: Whoa.n
Darryl: Oh, hey. Hey, whatxe2x80x99s up, yxe2x80x99all?n
Erin: You left us without saying goodbye.n
Darryl: Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.n
Meredith: Hey! No way!n
Kevin: Thatxe2x80x99s totally uncool.n
Erin: Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.n
Darryl: I donxe2x80x99t think I sh-n
Erin: Get upstairs, mister!n
Meredith: Yeah!n
Kevin: Right. Now.n
Darryl: Guess Ixe2x80x99m going upstairs.n
Jim: You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thingxe2x80x94none of these people are good enough.n
Dwight: I know.n
Jim: What Ixe2x80x99m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing Ixe2x80x99ve ever said.n
Dwight: Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-n
Jim: Is-n
Jim: The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute. n
Dwight: Yes! [weak applause] Thank you.n
Jim: I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] Thatxe2x80x99s it. You look really, really good.  n
Jim: Hey.n
Pam: Hey.n
Jim: You all right? Whatxe2x80x99s going on?n
Pam: Are you happy?n
Jim: Yes, Ixe2x80x99m happy.n
Pam: No, I know that youxe2x80x99re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.n
Jim: Yeah.n
Pam: And that was fun. But what about a year from now?n
Jim: What?n
Pam: What about five years from now?n
Jim: Pam.n
Pam: Because Ixe2x80x99m so glad youxe2x80x99re back, baby, but Ixe2x80x99m justxe2x80x94I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like youxe2x80x99re giving up so much.n
Jim: This was my decision, not yours.n
Pam: Okay.n
Jim: You didnxe2x80x99t force me.n
Pam: I kind of forced you to do it.n
Jim: You did not force me to do this.n
Pam: Yes, I did.n
Jim: I donxe2x80x99t know how else to tell you.n
Pam: Ixe2x80x99m afraid that youxe2x80x99re gonna resent me and Ixe2x80x99m afraid thatxe2x80x94n
Jim: Resent you?n
Pam: This is not enough for you and Ixe2x80x99m afraid that Ixe2x80x99m not enough for you.n
Jim: Not enough? I donxe2x80x99t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know itxe2x80x99s against the rules but Ixe2x80x99m gonna need a favor from you guys.n
Darryl: I didnxe2x80x99t realize we were this close.n
Phyllis: Wexe2x80x99re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.n
Meredith: Are you gonna come to Poor Richardxe2x80x99s and watch with us tonight?n
Darryl: Uhxe2x80xa6 yeah. Depending on traffic.n
Stanley: He ainxe2x80x99t coming.n
Darryl: Well, itxe2x80x99s been great.n
Phyllis: Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then hexe2x80x99s gone for who knows how long.n
Darryl: Maybe forever. Anyhowxe2x80x94n
Oscar: Did we ever have lunch together, justxe2x80x94just the two of us? You know what, Ixe2x80x99m gonna make reservations right now at Cuginoxe2x80x99s.n
Meredith: Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?n
Darryl: Oh, oh, Ixe2x80x99m sure we did.n
Meredith: Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.n
Clark: Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.n
Erin: Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darrylxe2x80x99s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then wexe2x80x99ll get this started.n
Darryl: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and thatxe2x80x99s on me. But Ixe2x80x99m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause youxe2x80x99re feeling sentimental. n
Meredith: You have to! [everyone grumbling]n
Darryl: Hey, hey, hey. Ixe2x80x99ll do one thing with yxe2x80x99all.n
Phyllis: Which thing?n
Angela: Kevin, Kevin.n
Kevin: Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]n
Angela: Kevin, could you not do that?n
Kevin: What? Ixe2x80x99m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.n
Oscar: Here, use my pen.n
Kevin: Donxe2x80x99t tell me what to do!n
Angela &amp; Oscar: Shhh!n
Kevin: No, I donxe2x80x99t need this! And you obviously donxe2x80x99t need me.n
Angela: Kevin, where are you going?n
Kevin: Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.n
Oscar: He just wonxe2x80x99t go down. Itxe2x80x99s as if hexe2x80x99s excited by all this paper.n
Angela: I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.n
Andy: Hey, whatxe2x80x99s goinxe2x80x99 on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the youngxe2x80x99uns?n
Casey: Youxe2x80x99re back!n
Andy: No, itxe2x80x99s me, Andy!n
Casey: No, I know.n
Andy: No, no, no. Ixe2x80x99m wearing makeup.n
Casey: You did a really great job. You even look shorter.n
Andy: Oh, I took out my lifts.n
Casey: Oh.n
Andy: Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.n
Esther: All day long, itxe2x80x99s moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs.n
Dwight: Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]n
Dwight: [puts his grandmotherxe2x80x99s ring away] Thank you, Esther.n
Esther: Bye.n
[Dwight throws xe2x80x9cNowxe2x80x9d beanie at Jimxe2x80x99s head]n
Jim: You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?n
Dwight: I need you to perform a test.n
Jim: Perform a test.n
Dwight: On an innocent baby.n
Jim: Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so Ixe2x80x99m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, donxe2x80x99t worry, hexe2x80x99s the best in the biz.n
Dwight: Damn straight.n
Jim: Unless you think he canxe2x80x99t handle it.n
Dwight: Hey, he can handle it.n
Oscar: [holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanleyxe2x80x99s sleeping. You donxe2x80x99t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?n
Stanley: I heard that.n
Phillip: Mama.n
Dwight: Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, therexe2x80x99s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.n
Pam: He does have a gift.n
Oscar: Well, hexe2x80x99s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.n
Phillip: Mama.n
Dwight: Phillip, you wanna play a little game? Itxe2x80x99s called xe2x80x9cSchrute or Consequences.xe2x80x9d Youxe2x80x99re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?n
Phillip: Beet.n
Check-in guy: Sorry, folks, the judges are totally swamped. We are all done taking auditions.n
People in line: Oh come on! Hey!n

Andy: Donxe2x80x99t touch me.n
Check-in guy: Ixe2x80x99m not touching you. Okay? [Andy makes a break for it]n
Oscar: Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I donxe2x80x99t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.n
Dwight: That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when hexe2x80x99s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.n
Andy: [interrupting contestant singing xe2x80x9cBeautifulxe2x80x9d by Christina Aguilera] Hi. Youxe2x80x99re still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. Youxe2x80x99re like, my three favorite people ever.n
Santigold: What is this?n
Andy: [shushing contestant] Sweetheart, youxe2x80x99re amazing, okay? Youxe2x80x99re obviously gonna be on the show, so itxe2x80x99s someone elsexe2x80x99s turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, [old man voice] my name is Ezra Cornell and Ixe2x80x99m just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.n
Aaron Rodgers: No, youxe2x80x99re a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on.n
Andy: Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.n
Clay Aiken: No, we do not want to hear you sing.n
Santigold: Gabriella was our last audition. Thank you. Goodbye.n
Andy: Nope! Canxe2x80x99t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my bossxe2x80x99s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.n
Aaron Rodgers: Flag on the play.n
Andy: Thatxe2x80x99sxe2x80x94thatxe2x80x99s whatxe2x80x94yeah. Okay, all right, well, herexe2x80x99s the song. [singing] Far above Cayugaxe2x80x99s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma materxe2x80x94n
Santigold: What is this song?n
Andy: Are you insane? Itxe2x80x99s the Cornell fight song.n
Clay Aiken: Listen, all right, thank you very much, wexe2x80x99re not interested.n
Andy: You didnxe2x80x99t let me finish. Thatxe2x80x99s not fair.n
Aaron Rodgers: Look, man, youxe2x80x99re not terrible. Wexe2x80x99ve heard a lot of really good singers today and youxe2x80x99re just not good enough.n
Andy: Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess thatxe2x80x99s the show. Let me try a different song, okay?n
Aaron Rodgers: Can he do this?n
Andy: [singing] Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, youxe2x80x99re never fully dressed without a smile. [falters at the judgesxe2x80x99 reactions] Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummellyxe2x80x94n
Santigold: Look, you gotta go. [Andy falls to his knees, sobbing] You canxe2x80x99t just sit here and cry.n
Oscar: Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?n
Kevin: Canxe2x80x99t hear you. Ixe2x80x99m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?n
Oscar: Okay, I guess, itxe2x80x99s just that Phillip got you something.n
Angela: Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.n
Oscar: I think therexe2x80x99s, like, $7 left.n
Angela: Itxe2x80x99s just his way of saying, xe2x80x9cThanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.xe2x80x9dn
Kevin: Phillip got this for me?n
Oscar: Sure.n
Kevin: That was a really cool move.n
Angela: Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. Thatxe2x80x99s Kevin.n
Kevin: Whoa.n
Oscar: Easy.n
Kevin: What a chubbers. Whoa.n
Angela: Okay, watch it.n
Kevin: Ixe2x80x99m losing my balance.n
Angela: No, Kevin, no.n
Oscar: Hey, no.n
Kevin: Whoa!n
Oscar: No horseplay.n
Angela: Stop it.n
Kevin: You wanna play with the cactus?n
Erin: We have our decision.n
Darryl: You chose one thing?n
Erin: We want to dance with you.n
Darryl: You want to dance?n
Erin: One dance, all of us together.n
Darryl: This is what you want?n
Erin: Absolutely.n
Darryl: Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause wexe2x80x99re gonna do this right.n
Angela: Hey. You wanted to see me?n
Dwight: Door. Chair. Itxe2x80x99s about Phillip.n
Angela: I am sorry hexe2x80x99s here today but I hadxe2x80x94n
Dwight: I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.n
Angela: How thoughtful.n
Dwight: Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, letxe2x80x99s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay manxe2x80x99s closet.n
Angela: If he is your son, thatxe2x80x99s a great plan. But hexe2x80x99s not. Hexe2x80x99s not your son.n
Dwight: Very well.n
Angela: Can I go back to my desk now?n
Pam: What is this?n
Jim: Well Ixe2x80x99ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldnxe2x80x99t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.n
Dwight: Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.n
Jim: OK, I donxe2x80x99t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.n
Dwight: [throws xe2x80x9cnowxe2x80x9d beanbag at Jim] Now.n
Jim: I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip. n
Dwight: Jim. Ixe2x80x99m not kidding. I need you.n
Pam: Go ahead.n
Jim: What do we got?n
Dwight: I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.n
Jim: Wow! Congratulations, thatxe2x80x99s a really big step.n
Dwight: Shexe2x80x99s got a ton of great qualities. Shexe2x80x99s young, shexe2x80x99s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because wexe2x80x99re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isnxe2x80x99t technically incest.n
Jim: Right in the sweet spot. I think youxe2x80x99re gonna be really happy.n
Dwight: Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.n
Jim: [whistles] Thatxe2x80x99s a lot of pros.n
Dwight: And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.n
Jim: So what is the problem?n
Jim: I donxe2x80x99t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time Ixe2x80x99ve been faced with a tough decision, therexe2x80x99s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation. n
Dwight: Some sort of virus?n
Jim: Love.n
Jim: Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman whoxe2x80x99s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.n
Dwight: Youxe2x80x99re a good assistant, Jim.n
Jim: Not as good as you.n
Dwight: Thatxe2x80x99s very true. Get the hell outta here. n
Jim: You got it.n</div>, <div class="quote">n[video shows teapot clip from xe2x80x9cChristmas Partyxe2x80x9d; Pam notices the card that Jim took back]n

Dwight: This expresses how loudly I love you.n
Angela: Itxe2x80x99s too loud.n
