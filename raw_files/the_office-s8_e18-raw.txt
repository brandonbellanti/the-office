Dwight is no longer with us.\n<br><b>Everyone:</b> [gasps] What?! Why is that?\n<br><b>Andy:</b> He\'s gone, damn it! He\'s been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he\'s staying in Florida forever.\n<br><b>Angela:</b> So, he\'s alive.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.\n<br><b>Angela:</b> Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.\n<br><b>Phyllis:</b> If Dwight\'s not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?\n<br><b>Oscar:</b> You guys, we\'ve gone over this, there is no treasure.

[cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office "Don\'t touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?"] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There\'s nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I\'m Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride. \n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Andy:</b> I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees]\n<br><b>Oscar:</b> I am dying to know what\'s in there.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody\'s gonna open it. You\'d have to be insane.

Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don\'t know that it\'s poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I\'m glad he\'s OK though.

We are a regular Archibald and his man George.\n<br><b>Robert California:</b> I bet. I\'m excited.\n<br><b>Nellie:</b> Trick... there\'s no such thing. It\'s not even a real English duo.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Ah!\n<br><b>Nellie:</b> I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn\'t exist either.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> [to Robert] You think you\'re excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh]\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Oh, that reminds me.

Want the same as last year?\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don\'t care what it is, dealer\'s choice.\n<br><b>Darryl:</b> I\'ll put you down for shortbreads.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Damn it. \n<br><b>Toby:</b> [entering Andy\'s office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha\'s first year in the troops, so I\'m selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?\n<br><b>Darryl:</b> No. No.\n<br><b>Toby:</b> What?\n<br><b>Darryl:</b> I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.\n<br><b>Toby:</b> You can\'t claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can\'t you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or?\n<br><b>Darryl:</b> You know what? It\'s your first time, let\'s split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don\'t know I\'ll just take, uh, accounting.\n<br><b>Toby:</b> That\'s it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl.\n<br><b>Darryl:</b> OK, great.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Darryl:</b> [exits Andy\'s office smiling] All I need is Kevin.

Relatively thin.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Erin:</b> [entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I\'m home, babaloo.\n<br><b>Elderly Woman:</b> [rises from chair] Oh, here let me help.\n<br><b>Erin:</b> [spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Erin:</b> Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don\'t know how she survived without me.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Irene:</b> When can I introduce you to my grandson? He\'s a wonderful swimmer. Shallow end, deep end. He does it all.\n<br><b>Erin:</b> Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I\'m staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]\n<br><b>Irene:</b> [takes mug] Thank you. [takes a sip] Oh, what kind of tea is this?\n<br><b>Erin:</b> Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Nellie:</b> [misses putt] Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see.

And fall time thinks that it\'s the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine\'s thinks that it\'s the best. But gather round, peeps, I\'ll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that\'s the truth.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Darryl:</b> [Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It\'s not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.\n<br><b>Toby:</b> [to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.\n<br><b>Darryl:</b> You\'re new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.\n<br><b>Toby:</b> No, no, no. It\'s not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> I do.\n<br><b>Toby:</b> See?\n<br><b>Darryl:</b> That doesn\'t mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> Oh, I definitely do.\n<br><b>Darryl:</b> [to Toby] Huh. Hit the road, jack.\n<br><b>Toby:</b> No, you hit the road, jack.\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> [looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don\'t fight over me.\n<br><b>Toby:</b> You know, why don\'t we split the order? It\'s only fair.\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> No. Wait, no. I\'m buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.\n<br><b>Angela:</b> Ugh.\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Nellie:</b> Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> [to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven\'t always got along and at times, I\'ve even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> [attempts to shake Dwight\'s hand] Goodbye, Dwight.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> [drops golf ball into Jim\'s open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen\'s bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Jim:</b> Well, he\'s Florida\'s problem now.\n<br><b>Robert California:</b> I\'ll let Dwight have his fun. Today will not be his day.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> What\'s that?\n<br><b>Robert California:</b> I\'m gonna tank the Sabre store at the presentation to the board.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> I thought you liked the store?\n<br><b>Robert California:</b> Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Thank you.\n<br><b>Robert California:</b> But, there\'s a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim? [Jim shakes head] They\'re cheap. They\'re unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone\'s wives do us.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.\n<br><b>Robert California:</b> I couldn\'t just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> [from distanced golf cart] Robert! I\'m gonna win, ha ha, I\'m the gentleman! Suck it!\n<br><b>Robert California:</b> [to Dwight] Bravo, Dwight! Very good! [Jim looks surprised] [to Jim] Shame.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Dwight:</b> [at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.\n<br><b>Nellie:</b> How did that look?\n<br><b>Gabe:</b> I\'m not just saying this, that was the best thing I\'ve ever seen.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> [to Nellie] I told you.\n<br><b>Todd Packer:</b> When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how \'bout I pop up also? I guess we\'d have to say \'power of three\'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to Nellie] You\'d spin off right. I\'d spin off-\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It\'s gonna make some really good toilet paper. \n<br><b>Jim:</b> [enters room] All right. There he is.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Can I just talk to you for one quick second?\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> What, your stylist ran out of \'messy spray\'? [others laugh]\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Um, actually it\'s, it\'s for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop \'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]\n<br><b>Todd Packer:</b> Nice. [To Jim] Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> [to Packer] Silence.\n<br><b>Todd Packer:</b> Aw, I\'m just trying to-\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> [interrupts] I know what you\'re trying to do, I don\'t want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.\n<br><b>Todd Packer:</b> That\'s... that\'s the same guy. It\'s the joke I made. \n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Different guy.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> You know, I just think you should know that-\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> [interrupts] That you look like the world\'s tallest hobbit. [others laugh]\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Jim:</b> Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it\'s on the record. I have a plane to catch. \n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Erin:</b> Can you help me? I\'m trying to make a video chat with Andy.\n<br><b>Irene:</b> Just open the program and type in his user name.\n<br><b>Erin:</b> Can you just do it?\n<br><b>Irene:</b> [after briefly typing] Here, type in your password. \n<br><b>Erin:</b> \'Erin123\'\n<br><b>Irene:</b> That\'s a terrible password. And you don\'t \'make a video chat\', you video chat.\n<br><b>Erin:</b> [annoyed] All right.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> [video chat begins, Andy\'s head enters the screen from the side] Hello?\n<br><b>Erin:</b> That\'s so weird. There\'s something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it. \n<br><b>Andy:</b> Oh, now mine\'s broken. Hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] Oh, there we go.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Pam:</b> [on phone with Jim] He said, \'I did like Dwight\'? He\'s gonna fire him.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> No, no, I think it was more like, \'you know, I liked him, but I don\'t anymore because he did a bad job, so I\'m definitely gonna yell at him\'.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Robert doesn\'t talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> I tried. He will not listen.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Did you actually try your hardest?\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven\'t dealt with him in awhile, all right. He\'s like super Dwight. It\'s like he\'s been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.\n<br><b>Stanley:</b> Don\'t talk to me.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Stanley\'s very upset that we\'re leaving Florida. But he would back me up.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> If Dwight\'s about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That\'s all you can do.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> OK. All right.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Darryl:</b> [to Kevin] What\'s a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can\'t trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.\n<br><b>Phyllis:</b> [laughs] Yeah.\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> That\'s true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby\'s probably in bed with some model. \n<br><b>Darryl:</b> Thank you.\n<br><b>Toby:</b> I\'m, I\'m not gonna comment on my personal life. \n<br><b>Darryl:</b>  Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?\n<br><b>Phyllis:</b> Oh.

And, like, buy you things. \n<br><b>Pam:</b> Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes. \n<br><b>Phyllis:</b> Make them kiss each other.\n<br><b>Meredith:</b> Make them kiss me.

Will you just let me tell you one thing, please? \n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store. \n<br><b>Dwight:</b> [rolls eyes] Jim, come on.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Dwight, he\'s gonna kill the store.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Uh-huh.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> And then, I\'m pretty sure he\'s gonna fire you for it. \n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Wait. [holds up fingers] He\'s gonna kill the store? And he\'s gonna fire me? \n<br><b>Jim:</b> Yes.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> [smiles] That\'s two things.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Dwight, please.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they\'re not going to work today.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> OK, first of all, they\'ve mostly worked, so-\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It\'s gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Dwight, come o-\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability.

I cannot do this without him.\n<br><b>Cathy:</b> I don\'t know. He\'s not picking up.\n<br><b>Todd Packer:</b> Well, looks like Shnoot\'s a no-show. Guess he wasn\'t vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I\'m your man.\n<br><b>Nellie:</b> [considers and decides on Packer] Right, let\'s begin then.

And she didn\'t bother to tell anyone.\n<br><b>Oscar:</b> We knew.

He clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible.\n<br><b>Nellie:</b> Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul. \n<br><b>Robert California:</b> That was never on the table.\n<br><b>Todd Packer:</b> [to Nellie] Are you kidding? [to Robert] She\'s the queen of the whole freaking Magilla!\n<br><b>Robert California:</b> And yet Todd, it\'s you who\'s fired.\n<br><b>Todd Packer:</b> What, you, I, I can\'t get fired.

I actually put on five pounds. \n<br><b>Phyllis:</b> [to Stanley] Hey!
