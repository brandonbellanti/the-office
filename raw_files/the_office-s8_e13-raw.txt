Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.\n<br><b>Phyllis:</b> Why?\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Why? Why?

You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim\'s house, and then back to the courthouse?\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour.
