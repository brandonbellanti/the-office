And up comes the toolbar, that\'s what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes. <br />\n<b>Ryan:</b> Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Why?<br />\n<b>Ryan:</b> You didn\'t prepare a presentation at all, did you?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.<br />\n<b>Ryan:</b> I\'m your boss.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> My other boss, Mr. Figaro.<br />\n<b>Ryan:</b> You have another job?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one\'s business but mine and my other business\'.<br />\n<b>Jim:</b> Are you a cocktail waitress?<br />\n<b>Ryan:</b> You can not have another job if it affects your work here.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> It won\'t.<br />\n<b>Ryan:</b> It did, all ready.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways.

Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever. <br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Huh, okay.<br />\n<b>Ryan:</b> What?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> It\'s whoever, not whomever.<br />\n<b>Ryan:</b> No, it\'s whomever.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> No, whomever is never actually right.<br />\n<b>Jim:</b> No, sometimes its right.<br />\n<b>Creed:</b> Michael is right. It\'s a made-up word used to trick students.<br />\n<b>Andy:</b> No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.<br />\n<b>Oscar:</b> Obviously it\'s a real word, but I don\'t know when to use it correctly.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Not a native speaker.<br />\n<b>Kevin:</b> I know what\'s right, but I\'m not gonna say, because you\'re all jerks who didn\'t come see my band last night.<br />\n<b>Ryan:</b> Do you really know which one is correct?<br />\n<b>Kevin:</b> I don\'t know.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> It\'s \'whom\' when it\'s the object of a sentence, and \'who\' when it\'s the subject.<br />\n<b>Phyllis:</b> Yeah, that sounds right.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Well it sounds right, but is it?<br />\n<b>Stanley:</b> How did Ryan use it? As an object?<br />\n<b>Ryan:</b> As an object.<br />\n<b>Kelly:</b> Ryan used me an object.<br />\n<b>Stanley:</b> Is he right about that?<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> How did he use it again?<br />\n<b>Toby:</b> It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Thank you.<br />\n<b>Toby:</b> To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever\'s name is Toby, why don\'t you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.<br />\n<b>Ryan:</b> Wait! This doesn\'t matter. And I don\'t even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you\'re fired here. <br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Michael:</b> I\'ve never done this before.

So, you are filming history.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Michael:</b> Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs.  One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---<br />\n<b>Mr. Figaro:</b> Lipophedrine<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.<br />\n<b>Mr. Figaro:</b> Never heard of it.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I can\'t do this.<br />\n<b>Mr. Figaro:</b> Are you quitting?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> I am.<br />\n<b>Mr. Figaro:</b> Come back anytime, don\'t forget to disinfect your headset.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Michael:</b> I was never in this for the money.  But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.  I tried to live the dream.  I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed.  But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Andy:</b> So.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> What\'s up?<br />\n<b>Andy:</b> Me.  All night.  Dreaming about Angela\'s smoking hot body.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> You\'re being gross.<br />\n<b>Andy:</b> Not from a male perspective.  You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she\'s looking, and she\'s totally not responding to my moves.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> What moves?<br />\n<b>Andy:</b> I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> I can\'t believe that\'s not working.<br />\n<b>Andy:</b> Yeah.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> Um, I don\'t know if I really see you two together.<br />\n<b>Andy:</b> Really?  Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> She\'s very religious.<br />\n<b>Andy:</b> Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.<br />\n<b>Andy:</b> Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> That\'s right, you did.<br />\n<b>Andy:</b> Yeah.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Pam:</b> Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn\'t do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Michael:</b> Hey Kevin, you\'re a gambler right?  A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.<br />\n<b>Kevin:</b> I do gamble Michael.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I don\'t know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he\'s tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?<br />\n<b>Kevin:</b> The mob.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Do you know anybody in the mob?<br />\n<b>Kevin:</b> [shakes head no]<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Okay, um, Oscar, I\'m going to need to take another advance on my salary.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Kelly:</b> What do you mean you have plans tonight?<br />\n<b>Darryl:</b> I have my daughter tonight; we\'re renting Charlotte\'s Web.<br />\n<b>Kelly:</b> Well, you have to make a choice, it\'s either your daughter, or me.<br />\n<b>Darryl:</b> My daughter.<br />\n<b>Kelly:</b> Okay, I see how it is.

[camera pans to each face in the break room]  Okay, I know what\'s going on.  You\'re talking about Jim and Pam, if they\'re having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think---<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> Michael.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Hey, hey, hey.<br />\n<b>Oscar:</b> Michael, are you having money problems?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Monkey problem? No, I\'m not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems?<br />\n<b>Oscar:</b> You heard me correctly.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Oh, I hate monkeys.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> What\'s going on, why do you have a second job?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> I don\'t have a second job.  Maybe I\'m having an affair with Suzanne Summers.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> Doesn\'t Jan have money?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> I don\'t talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual.<br />\n<b>Kevin:</b> True, it\'s best to hide our money problems from women.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> I totally agree with you.  But I don\'t have money problems, I don\'t.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]<br />\n<b>Oscar and Stanley:</b> You just put it back in your pocket.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Yeah, but I destroyed it, it\'s not even useable anymore.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Darryl:</b> Hey, let\'s call this what it is.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Darryl:</b> It\'s like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It\'s gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Kelly:</b> Well, I just need to know where this is going.<br />\n<b>Darryl:</b> Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what\'s not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing\'s run its course.<br />\n<b>Kelly:</b> Don\'t you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I\'ve ever met in my entire---<br />\n<b>Darryl:</b> Slow down, think it over.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Kelly:</b>  Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I\'ve ever met.

You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Creed:</b> Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy.  When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Michael:</b> How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.<br />\n<b>Creed:</b> You don\'t go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts.  Nobody just picks up "get out of jail free" cards, those things cost thousands.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> That is a good point.<br />\n<b>Creed:</b> Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature\'s do-over.  It\'s a fresh start, it\'s a clean slate.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Like the witness protection program.<br />\n<b>Creed:</b> Exactly.<br />\n<b>Oscar:</b> Not at all.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Michael:</b> I\'ve always wanted to be in the witness protection program.  Fresh start, no debts, no baggage.  I\'ve already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.  I\'m a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.  That\'s the life.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Michael:</b> I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Oscar:</b> Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can\'t just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> I didn\'t say it, I declared it.<br />\n<b>Oscar:</b> Still, that\'s not anything.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Oscar:</b> This is a lot of credit card debt.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Yeah, tell me about it.<br />\n<b>Oscar:</b> Mmm.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she\'s using them as if I\'m made of money, she thinks I\'m a human ATM machine.<br />\n<b>Oscar:</b> Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Oh, that\'s the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.<br />\n<b>Oscar:</b> Twelve hundred dollars.  What\'s a Core Blaster Extreme?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think that\'s how they got a core.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Andy:</b> I left a little present for Angela.  I think she\'s going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together.  I got game.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Oscar:</b> Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.<br />\n<b>Oscar:</b> The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Right.<br />\n<b>Oscar:</b> This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point?<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Pam:</b> Man, Angela really had a hold on him.
