Thanks for filling these out and I promise this\'ll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Michael:</b> You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don\'t look at you as another race.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Mr. Brown:</b> Uh, see this is what I\'m talking about. We don\'t have to pretend we\'re color-blind.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Michael:</b> Exactly, were not...<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Mr. Brown:</b> That\'s fighting ignorance with more ignorance.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Michael:</b> With tolerance.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Mr. Brown:</b> No. With more ignorance.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Michael:</b> Ignorance.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Mr. Brown:</b> Right.

OK.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Michael:</b> Celebrate good times. Come on! Let\'s celebrate diversity. Right?<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Mr. Brown:</b> Yes, exactly. Now here\'s what we\'re going to do. I\'ve noticed that...<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Michael:</b> You know what? Here\'s what we\'re going to do. Why don\'t we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Dwight:</b> I have two. White and Indian.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Mr. Brown:</b> Actually, I\'d prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Michael:</b> Yes.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Mr. Brown:</b>  Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Michael:</b> OK.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Mr. Brown:</b> Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I\'m going to do is choose one and we\'re going to act it out.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Dwight:</b> A few of the ground rules? <br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Michael:</b> Hey, hey why don\'t you run it by me and I\'ll run it by him.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Dwight:</b> OK, can we steer away from gay people?<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Mr. Brown:</b> Um...<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Dwight:</b> I\'m sorry. It\'s an orientation. It\'s not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Mr. Brown:</b> Well, we only have an hour.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Dwight:</b> I figured it would save time.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Michael:</b> OK.

I will not call you that.<br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Mr. Brown:</b> Well, it\'s my name. It\'s not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I\'ve noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it\'s the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good.
