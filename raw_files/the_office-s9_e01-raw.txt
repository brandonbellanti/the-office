[pushes Nellie off slack line] You suck. Alright, who\xe2\x80\x99s next? Darryl?\n<br><b>Darryl:</b> This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.\n<br><b>Clark:</b> Uh, I guess I could give it shot.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.\n<br><b>Clark:</b> Ok\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa!

It\xe2\x80\x99s a tightrope for babies. Boo!\n<br><b>Clark:</b> Alright, let\xe2\x80\x99s see you do it.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Ok, I am just getting started, ok?\n<br><b>Clark:</b> You got this, it\xe2\x80\x99s all you. [as Dwight repeatedly fails and gets smacked around] Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a race, Dwight.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Well it\xe2\x80\x99s official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> [bleeding heavily from the mouth] That\xe2\x80\x99s not true.  Just give me another chance.\n<br><b>Oscar:</b> But your mouth is ble\xe2\x80\x94\n<br><b>Toby:</b> This is a bloodbath. Alright, I\xe2\x80\x99m calling this.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> What?\n<br><b>Toby:</b> It is enough of this. Everyone, let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to work.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Dwight:</b> Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem so macho now, does it? It\xe2\x80\x99s a jump rope!\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Pam:</b> Dwight!\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder.

What are your ambitions?\n<br><b>Pete:</b> I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.\n<br><b>Angela:</b> Have you taken any concrete steps?\n<br><b>Pete:</b> Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Jim:</b> Oh, come on, Pete! God, that\xe2\x80\x99s just sad. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t watch himself, he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Dwight:</b> Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it\xe2\x80\x99s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> I will?\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you say?\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> So you\xe2\x80\x99ll do it?\n<br><b>Pam:</b> No.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Come on.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Exactly the way it is.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> No, Pam.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Yes, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Please? Please, Pam?\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Find someone else, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Ask Phyllis.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> I can\xe2\x80\x99t use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I\xe2\x80\x99ll be launched into space.

The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle.
