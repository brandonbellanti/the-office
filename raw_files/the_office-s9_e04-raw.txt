[clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> At five? That\'s only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.\n<br><b>Angela:</b> So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> Wh...\n<br><b>Oscar:</b> Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> 314 pies.\n<br><b>Oscar:</b> What if it were salads?\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> Well, it\'s the...carry the four...and...it doesn\'t work.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> I\'m sorry to spoil Jim\'s fantastic voyage everyone, but we\'re almost out of gas.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Hey honey, I don\'t think we should push him.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Oh no, I\'m gonna push him. You know why? Because you\'re getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He\'s trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won\'t get there. Is that what we want?!\n<br><b>Group:</b> No!\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Stop ordering me around, Jim!\n<br><b>Jim:</b> What do we want?!\n<br><b>Group:</b> Pies!\n<br><b>Jim:</b> When do we want it?!\n<br><b>Group:</b> Pies!\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> OK, fine. You win.  Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in Jim\'s lap] Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> That\'s impossible. [Dwight climbs through ceiling hatch] Dwight!\n<br><b>Meredith:</b> Oh my!\n<br><b>Jim:</b> What are you doing?\n<br><b>Meredith:</b> Dwight, what the hell?\n<br><b>Oscar:</b> Dwight!\n<br><b>Clark:</b> What?\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> Well now I don\'t even feel like pie.

That\'s not safe.\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour we\'re just gonna barely make it.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> [to Jim] Go up and check on him. He\'s upset.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> You know he\'s doing all this on purpose.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Please? Just make sure he\'s OK? [Jim climbs through hatch]\n<br><b>Stanley:</b> Hurry it up for god\'s sake. They\'re gonna be out of banana cream!\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Banana cream is the first to go.  We\'ll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point!

I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> I\'m barren, Jim.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> What?\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?\n<br><b>Jim:</b> No.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> That\'s genius. That\'s the best prank you\'ve ever done.

Uh, ok, [reading] blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you\'ve made this very easy for me.

Crying sounds come from behind Nelly\'s curtain] British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?\n<br><b>Pete:</b> I don\'t think that\'s Nelly.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> What?\n<br><b>Nellie:</b> Oh, oh no, no. Look, it\'s alright. [Erin cries, Nelly comforts her] It really isn\'t your fault. No, no. Look, it\'s...you were so kind. And it isn\'t anything to do with you.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Jim:</b> Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we\'re all kinda like your children?\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> You know there\'s a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Bildenkinder.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> OK.
