Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn\'t feel like a priority. So I guess my question [reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it] for you would be [reading off sheet] how many clients do you have?<br />\n<b>Prince Grandfather:</b> About 80.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Really? That many? This doesn\'t seem like a very big operation.<br />\n<b>Prince Grandfather:</b> It\'s just me, my wife and my son.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Ah, so when did you set up shop?<br />\n<b>Prince Grandfather:</b> I opened this place after I came back from Vietnam.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Oh Vietnam, I hear it\'s lovely .<br />\n<b>Prince Grandfather:</b> [muted] Mmhmm.

I am a genius.<br />\n<b>Prince Grandfather:</b> Oh really?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? [picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion] Is this the cup? [picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion] Is this what I drink out of? [glug noise, both laugh] Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession. <br />\n<b>Dwight:</b> Hello, I would like to apply for a job. <br />\n<b>Prince Grandfather:</b> Hi, I\'m afraid we\'re not hiring right now.<br />\n<b>Dwight:</b> Why don\'t you just get rid of this guy?

Dwight Schrute, I\'m a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I\'m the top salesman there and I\'m looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Try 80.<br />\n<b>Dwight:</b> Pshaw, that\'s nothing. I\'ve 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.<br />\n<b>Prince Grandfather:</b> I sure hope not.<br />\n<b>Dwight:</b> Me too.

Jim, just show us a picture.<br />\n<b>Oscar:</b> Kevin, c\'mon.<br />\n<b>Kelly:</b> Yeah, shut up Kevin.<br />\n<b>Kevin:</b> He\'s making all these fancy, uh, it\'s a gut thing.<br />\n<b>Jim:</b> Kevin, you know what, why don\'t you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the "hot" team to their great joy] Does that end the debate? <br />\n<b>Kevin:</b> [Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to "not hot" team] No, it\'s is she hot, not would you do her.
