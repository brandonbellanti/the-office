So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call\xe2\x80\xa6Dwight\xe2\x80\xa6\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you\'re out.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you\'ve ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.\n<br><b>Kelly:</b> What emails are you talking about?\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Robert\'s favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn\'t strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.\n<br><b>Kelly:</b> That\'s not that bad actually.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> P.S. We should should kill him.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> No, it\'s an accountability booster.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Jim, you\'re trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.\n<br><b>Kelly:</b> Um, no we\'re not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.\n<br><b>Ryan:</b> We can\'t do this Dwight.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> [Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smile\xe2\x80\xa6nod.
