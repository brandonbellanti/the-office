When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn\'t until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it\'s over. [overcome by emotion] I\'m sorry, this is... oh my god, OK. [to Pam] We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> [obviously flustered] Yeah.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> What?\n<br><b>Brian:</b> At least my crying won\'t get you fired.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Crying?\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Andy:</b> I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account.

All right? That\'s more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?\n<br><b>Erin:</b> Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he\'s gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don\'t want that on my hands. \n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Fine! The state he\'s in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> [appears approaching group, shaved and in a suit] What\'s going on in here, dirty players? Let\'s get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. [singing] Who\'s that girl? Who\'s that girl? It\'s Andy! [resumes talking] All right. Back to work.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Pam:</b> OK, I can tell you\'re mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don\'t know, tell me why? \n<br><b>Jim:</b> I don\'t know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don\'t know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> I didn\'t tell you about the crying because I didn\'t want you to know how upset I was. Because it would\'ve stressed you out and you\'re always saying how much you don\'t want more stress.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you. \n<br><b>Pam:</b> It\'s not Brian\'s fault.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> No, you\'re right. And, and I\'m not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don\'t have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn\'t there. So, let\'s just forget about it.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> OK.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Andy:</b> I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Not helpful. Let\'s stay positive, people. OK?\n<br><b>David Wallace:</b> [enters] Hey guys.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.\n<br><b>David Wallace:</b> Sounds great. Don\'t let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn\'t be happier with the numbers.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Thank you.\n<br><b>David Wallace:</b> Well, finish up. I\'m gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Great!\n<br><b>David Wallace:</b> [leaving] Great job, everybody!\n<br><b>Andy:</b> [whispering] We had to let a warehouse guy go?!\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> You know Pam\'s mural? Well, Frank...\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> [interrupting] \xe2\x80\xa6 lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.    \n<br><b>Andy:</b> What?! \n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Yeah.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> There was a fire in the warehouse?\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers. \n<br><b>Kevin:</b> Whoa.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> This is what I\'m talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?\n<br><b>Phyllis:</b> We started selling balloons.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> What?!\n<br><b>Clark:</b> Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> No kidding?\n<br><b>Clark:</b> Yeah. In the European billboards, she\'s gonna be topless.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Wow. Go Kathy. She\'s like 50.\n<br><b>Clark:</b> They\'re tasteful.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Good, good. What else?\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Andy:</b> Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.\n<br><b>David Wallace:</b> What fire?\n<br><b>Andy:</b> The warehouse fire. Weren\'t you just down there? It\'s like burnt to ashes.\n<br><b>David Wallace:</b> It looked fine to me.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> [catches on to the ruse] I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that\'s one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.\n<br><b>David Wallace:</b> OK.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> I think you\'ll agree I explained that pretty well. \n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>David Wallace:</b> [preparing to leave] Thanks, Andy. \n<br><b>Andy:</b> Thank you.\n<br><b>David Wallace:</b> All right.

You think I need a new fish?\n<br><b>Erin:</b> I don\'t love you anymore.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> What?\n<br><b>Erin:</b> I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn\'t really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don\'t love you.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> OK, I get it. You\'re unhappy. I\'ve been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.\n<br><b>Erin:</b> I just said there isn\'t love.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> On your side. But there\'s tons on my side. It\'s gushing. We\'re just out of sync right now. But that\'s just timing, it\'s timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.\n<br><b>Erin:</b> I guess.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we\'re lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.\n<br><b>Erin:</b> You got really sunburned.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> I\'m gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.\n<br><b>Erin:</b> Ugh.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won\'t be able to tell the difference. So, I\'ll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you\'ll actually start to love me again.\n<br><b>Erin:</b> You really think we can get that back?\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Yes. [hugs Erin] Come on. Totally.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Jim:</b> You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Oh?\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I\'m sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don\'t know, drop me at the bus station?\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Are you sure?\n<br><b>Jim:</b> I just feel like we\'re gonna fight.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> [obviously hurt] Yeah.    \n<br><b>Jim:</b> So... how \'bout let\'s not?\n<br><b>Pam:</b> OK. [they begin to leave]\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine\'s Day. Sorry, I didn\'t have time to wrap it.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> [sees it\'s a drawing of hers, framed] Wow. I didn\'t know you kept this.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Yeah, yeah.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Thank you.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> No problem.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> I don\'t think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.   \n<br><b>Jim:</b> You really wanna fight on Valentine\'s Day?\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Yeah, I do.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> OK.
