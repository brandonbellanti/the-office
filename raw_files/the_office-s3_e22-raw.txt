I want to say something. I\'ve been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn\'t even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn\'t any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It\'s like sometimes some of you act like I don\'t even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we\'re not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn\'t have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn\'t care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you\'re with someone else. And that\'s... fine. It\'s... whatever. That\'s not what... I\'m not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I\'m just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It\'s a good day. <br />\n\t\t\t\t<b>Michael:</b> Pam, that was amazing.
