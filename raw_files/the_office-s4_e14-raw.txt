Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans\' funeral?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?<br />\n<b>Angela:</b> Michael...<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-<br />\n<b>Angela:</b> No. You know-no!<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Toga!<br />\n<b>Angela:</b> You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won\'t be in them.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe; hums; takes out cash from shoe]<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\t\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Michael:</b> Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn\'t know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. "Michael, buy a motorcycle." So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\t\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Michael:</b> I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> So how much antigravity potion do you want?<br />\n<b>Angela:</b> No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don\'t want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Phyllis, can you do this?<br />\n<b>Phyllis:</b> [whispers] Yes.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\t\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Pam:</b> Hi, can I help you?<br />\n<b>Holly:</b> Hi.

I said that they\'d love those sketches. Congratulations!<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> Oh, thank you! I don\'t know why I doubted it, because I\'m so clearly awesome!<br />\n<b>Jim:</b> Yes! So when do you start?<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> I don\'t know, I didn\'t read it carefully, I just saw "congratulations" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.<br />\n<b>Jim:</b> Wow. Busy morning.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...<br />\n<b>Jim:</b> It\'s not a big deal. I\'ll come visit you. And you\'ll visit me. It\'s only two hours away. It\'ll be fine. That part\'s gonna suck, but it\'ll be great.<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> Yeah, it sucks, but it\'ll be great.<br />\n<b>Jim:</b> See how easy that is?<br />\n<b>Pam:</b> Ohh... [they hug; she laughs]<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\t\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Pam:</b> I wouldn\'t go if things weren\'t so solid with Jim.

Ugh. Wow.<br />\n<b>Dwight:</b> So what do we know about her?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Well, we know that Toby thinks she\'ll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.<br />\n<b>Dwight:</b> I hate her too.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Why do you hate her?<br />\n<b>Dwight:</b> Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don\'t know, I think you say things just to agree with me.<br />\n<b>Dwight:</b> Would that be such a bad thing?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?<br />\n<b>Dwight:</b> What?<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> We need to sell her an elevator pass.<br />\n<b>Dwight:</b> But our, our elevator doesn\'t require a pa...

Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here\'s how things work here:</b> my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert:</b> I\'m gonna win.<br />\n<b>Holly:</b> Man, someone doesn\'t like H.R.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Yeah.<br />\n<b>Holly:</b> [to Toby] What did you do to him?<br />\n<b>Toby:</b> Nothing.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.<br />\n<b>Holly:</b> Yeah, I know what you mean.

I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she\'s just an awesome woman from this planet.<br />\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\t\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Creed:</b> [shaking Holly\'s hand] The pleasure\'s all mine.<br />\n<b>Holly:</b> Oh, thanks.

You don\'t love Holly.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> I think I do.<br />\n<b>Jim:</b> But you just met her.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> Well, it was love at first sight.

And you can think that. But you don\'t say that out loud, and you definitely don\'t say it to her.<br />\n<b>Michael:</b> I don\'t want her to get away.<br />\n<b>Jim:</b> I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and...

Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best.
