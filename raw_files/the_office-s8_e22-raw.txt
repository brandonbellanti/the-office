Wow, I can\'t tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets\' remember we are all here for the dog society. He\'s what\'s important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night!
