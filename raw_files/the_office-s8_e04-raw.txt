Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?\n<br><b>Andy:</b> I get it, I\'m being a little overbearing.

Not a barbecue. It\'s better than a barbecue. It\'s dignified, quieter, there are rules. \n<br><b>Pam:</b> How is that better than a barbecue?\n<br><b>Ryan:</b> What\'s the dress code on this?\n<br><b>Andy:</b> I\'m glad you asked \xe2\x80\x93 Connecticut Casual.\n<br><b>Stanley:</b> Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I\'m wearing to your party.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother\'s promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there\'s a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet. [video playing on computer]\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this. \n<br><b>Darryl:</b> I\'ve seen this, that\'s not you.\n<br><b>Meredith:</b> Yeah, whoa, who\'s the sausage?\n<br><b>Andy:</b> It\'s my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn\'t really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that\'s my brother\'s boss. Look how psyched he is, he\'s having an awesome time.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did.

I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> There\'s so much more to it than that.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Dwight:</b> I\'ve been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity.

You want to toast the man who led you to success, but the boss is irrelevant. Andy and I, we produce nothing. We do nothing. We sit in our offices and demand, I want this and that right now, like petulant children. You know, the difference between a crying baby and a manager, one day the baby will grow up.

Why don\'t you come up and join us?\n<br><b>Walter Jr:</b> Dad, no. I\'m just having a good time getting to know Andy\'s friends here.\n<br><b>Meredith:</b> Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you\'ll never be able to sing again. Woo!\n<br><b>Walter & Walter Jr:</b> [singing] May the good lord be with you down every road you roam. And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you\'re far from home. And may you grow to be proud, dignified and true. And do unto others as you\'d have done to you...\n<br><b>Andy:</b> [applauds] Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar.\n<br><b>Erin\'s Cell Phone:</b> If you\'d like to make a call, please hang up and try again.\n<br><b>Erin:</b> Sorry.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Kelly:</b> I am so cold.\n<br><b>Ryan:</b> That\'s because you didn\'t bring a jacket.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Dwight:</b> My first love is beet farming, but it\'s a young man\'s game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?\n<br><b>Robert:</b> Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it\'s still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking? \n<br><b>Robert:</b> Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> I can get you exotic meats \xe2\x80\x93 hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...\n<br><b>Robert:</b> We\'ll talk. [walks away]\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> It\'ll all be goat.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Andy:</b> Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I\'d very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn\'t even my worst sales call. \n<br><b>Walter:</b> [knocks] Hi. What was that display?\n<br><b>Andy:</b> I don\'t know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you\'d be proud of me. \n<br><b>Walter:</b> Andrew...\n<br><b>Andy:</b> I know, I know that you\'re proud of me. \n<br><b>Walter:</b> I\'m not going to tell you how impressed I am that you\'re a manager of some rinky dink branch of a paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. How long are you going to go on needing my approval? You\'re a grown man, don\'t act like a little boy who needs...\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Darryl:</b> I think if I had parents like that I\'d be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.\n<br><b>Oscar:</b> Guess we found Andy\'s rosebud.\n<br><b>Darryl:</b> Rosebud?\n<br><b>Oscar:</b> It\'s a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are. \n<br><b>Darryl:</b> I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn\'t explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.\n<br><b>Oscar:</b> Different school of thought. Let\'s just agree to disagree.\n<br><b>Darryl:</b> No. You\'re wrong. \n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Robert:</b> Are you sure?\n<br><b>Ryan:</b> Yeah! I\'m too hot anyway.\n<br><b>Robert:</b> My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn\'t that strange? I\'ve never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that\'s nice. Thank you.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Walter:</b> It was a nice party, the setting was a little strange. Uh, the food...\n<br><b>Ellen:</b> Sandwiches were dry.\n<br><b>Walter Jr:</b> Bye Tuna, bye Pam! \n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Andy:</b> Hey everybody, I\'m gonna leave and I just wanted to say I\'m really sorry.\n<br><b>Darryl:</b> Cheeseburger or hamburger.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Um, cheeseburger.\n<br><b>Oscar:</b> Narddog. [throws Andy a can]\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Thanks, Oscar. \n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Pam:</b> What are they doing?\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Closing ceremonies.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Nice touch.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Jim:</b> I think I left my wallet in your house.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> Who cares.\n<br><b>Jim:</b> Right here.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> MR.

What are you doing? \n<br><b>Jim:</b> Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> That\'s a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!\n</div>\n\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n<div class="DSblock">\n<b><u>Deleted Scene 1</u></b>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\t\t\t\t\t\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Oscar:</b> I cannot believe how condescending Andy\'s being.\n<br><b>Darryl:</b> He gets condescending when he\'s nervous. Or when he\'s excited or sleepy. Not an easy person to be friends with.\n<br><b>Meredith:</b> Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I\'m a lady. I\'m a mother. I\'m a former boxer!\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit?\n<br><b>Ryan:</b> Can\'t wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment\'s at 9%. I wouldn\'t miss it for the world.\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Awesome.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Dwight:</b> Erin....the receptionist!\n<br><b>Andy:</b> Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d\'oeuvres and the animals on Noah\'s ark?\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> What?\n<br><b>Andy:</b> With Hors d\'oeuvres we only take one at a time.\n<br><b>Kevin:</b> Oh, OK. What\'s the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Jim:</b> Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.\n<br><b>Dwight:</b> When all this is over, I\'d like to actually go to one of Trickington\'s parties, they sound like a blast.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Dwight:</b> Ladies and Gentlemen!

Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn\'t even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It\'s just something you do to a hole!\n<br><b>Pam:</b> Well I\'m having my baby first, so that\'s that.\n<br><b>Angela:</b> You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I\'ll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.\n<br><b>Pam:</b> You think your doctor\'s going to give you a C-section at six months?\n<br><b>Angela:</b> Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.\n</div>\n<div class="spacer">&nbsp</div>\n\n<div class="quote">\n<b>Andy:</b> My parents are used to a certain type of class.
